<p class="text">
 The standard PLC system has three main parts input modules, CPU-Controller and output modules, you PLC system can work with or without a physical input/output. The CPU
 and memory is utilize with <number>5</number> volts.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li><underline yellow>Input Modules</underline>: Collect data from sensors, potentiometer or push buttons and convert them into digital/analog numbers</li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Controller/CPU</underline>: Controller updates the code loaded in the CPU with the data received from the input module, then execute the code and
   generates a new results
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Output Modules</underline>: Our output module pick-up the updated results and converts them into different forms of electric signals to control
   devices such relays and actuators
  </li>
 </ul>

<p class="text">
 As we know our PLC/CPU is powered by <number>24VDC</number>, either is provided by internal or external power supply. For internal power supply you need
 <number>120/220V AC</number> power source to power your PLC, this means you PLC has an internal power supply which our <number>120/220V AC</number> will be converted
 into <number>24V DC</number>.
</p>

<p class="text">If your PLC need a <number>24VDC</number> then this means that you need to provide an external power supply that gives you <number>24VDC</number>.</p>

<div class="text-box tip">
 <p>
  It's better to invest in a reliable power supply either buying an external module PS that your PLC vendor manufacture, or buy a PLC with internal power supply if the
  PLC suits your requirement based on the consumption or PLC system design.

<p class="text">
 CPU stand for <text>Central Processing Unit</text> is the key part of the PLC system, it processes the input, executes the logic program code and base on that it
 generates the outputs.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>Your CPU can run code with or without a direct physical input/output in a PLC system.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 To run code program in PLC, you must connect the CPU via programming device, we connect to our PLC thru a connection to standard ethernet port using
 <tooltip image="/img/image010.PNG" desc="">RJ-45</tooltip> ethernet cable.
</p>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>Back-in a day every PLC has a special programmer and connecting cables, now everything has been simplified.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Every PLC has different <tooltip desc="It commonly refers to a list of things being offered, such as items for sale">catalog</tooltip> with multiple model of CPUs with
 different capabilities like <underline>processing power</underline> and <underline>memory size</underline>. Various model will give you the flexibility and freedom to
 select the right one for your application.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <p class="list-title">The CPU in PLC do the following operations :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Updating inputs and outputs. This function allows a PLC to read the status of its input terminals and energize or deenergize its output terminals.</li>
  <li>Performing logic and arithmetic operations. A CPU conducts all the mathematic and logic operations involved in a PLC.</li>
  <li>
   Communicating with memory. The PLC's programs and data are stored in memory. When a PLC is operating, its CPU may read or change the contents of memory locations.
  </li>
  <li>
   Scanning application programs. An application program, which is called a ladder logic program, is a set of instructions written by a PLC programmer. The scanning
   function allows the PLC to execute the application program as specified by the programmer.
  </li>
  <li>Communicating with a programming terminal. The CPU transfers program and data between itself and the programming terminal.</li>
 </ul>

<p class="text">
 First step is <text orange>Startup Mode</text> which is executed before the <text green>RUN Mode</text>. Lets see the following mode that our PLC goes thru.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image018.PNG" alt="image" />

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text orange">
 - Startup Mode
</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text"><letter>A</letter> - The process image input is cleared, all inputs are cleared and set to <number>0</number>.</p>

<p class="text"><letter>B</letter> - Output are initilized with last value. If PLC goes off then ON, the last stored outputs values are restored.</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>Restoring values only with PLCs that has a retentive memory, there are some memories which does not retain last values if the power goes OFF.</p>
</div>

<p class="text"><letter>C</letter> - Any startup logic is executed, there are some special startup bits which are executed before the run mode.</p>

<p class="text">
 <letter> D</letter> - Status of physical input is copied to I-Memory. Here will start writing the current input status into memory, all the inputs status will be updated
 into memory.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>As we know PLC has a dedicated memory to store the status of inputs, this memory is called Process-Image-Input.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 <letter>E</letter> - any interrupts presents are queued to execute. interrupts are some special instruction which has higher priority over normal PLC scan cycle. These instruction are
 executed without caring about the PLC scan it will execute the instructions immediately.
</p>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  interrupts instruction are queued or lined-up in startup mode and they are not executed, only executed on the RUN Mode. execute is prioritize to prevent and avoid any
  delays.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 <letter>F</letter> - At last, here PLC enables the process memory output for the physical outputs. Here the status of our outputs are stored or written in memory (its just enable not executed)
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">
  - Run Mode
 </p>
 <!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
  The <text green>Run mode</text green> starts after te <text orange>startup mode</text>
</p>

<p class="text">
 <number>1</number> - In Run mode Q-Memory is written to physical output. When you have some logic in your PLC and this logic is solved then the answer of the output is stored in process memory, 
 then the output result will have either a voltage or not. If the output is one then it will give a voltage which could be 24V or common to the terminal to start executing these physical outputs. 
</p>

<div class="text-box">
<p>
 Whatever information that you have in the memory of output is given to the output terminals.
</p>
</div> 

<p class="text">
 <number>2</number> - The state of physical input is written into I-Memory. here the state of physical inputs is written into the I-Memory.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <number>3</number> - Then the logic is executed
</p>

<p class="text">
 <number>4</number> - at last, self-test diagnostic is performed, if you have any errors in your PLC it will diagnose it and it will indicate the error in your computer or HMI.
 This step is perform ny itself
</p>

<p class="text">
 Then, again it will go back to first step and passing thru each step, this cycle keeps repeating this is called scan cycle. These scan cycle depends on three things
</p>

<div class="list-content normal number">
 <ul>
  <li>How many inputs do you have, PLC read those inputs </li>
  <li>Logic execution time, it will depend upon the length of your logic</li>
  <li>Also, it depends upon the number of the outputs</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="text-box note">
<p>
 Interrupts and <tooltip desc="read and write I/O in some external communication device like HMI">communication</tooltip> are processed during any part of cycle

<p class="text">
 The CPU has three modes of operation: <text orange>STOP mode</text>, <text orange>Startup Mode</text> and <text green>RUN Mode</text>. Status LEDs on the front of the CPU indicate the current mode of operation
</p>

<p class="text">
 In <text green>Run Mode</text>, the scan cycle is executed repeatedly. Interrupts events can occur and be processes at any point within rhe program cycle phase
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image019.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 In <text orange>Stop Mode</text>, the CPU is not executing the program which mean there is no scan cycle, and in this mode you can download a project
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image020.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 In <text orange>startup Mode</text>, the CPU executes any startup logic (If present). Interrupt events are not processed during the startup mode. Below we will show how startup mode is indicated by our PLC LED.
 Its blinks in the startup mode then it goes into the Run Mode.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image021.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 You can control these three modes of PLC using the software TIA, it provides options like Run, Stop and reset (for resetting the memory)
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
<p>
 You can download your project only when the CPU is in <red>STOP</red> Mode.
