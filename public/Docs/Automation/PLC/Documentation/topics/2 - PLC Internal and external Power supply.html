 The PLC power supply converts a line voltage commonly <number>120/220V</number> AC into a usable <number>12/24V</number> DC, this DC voltage is used to power the rest of
 the PLC and components.
</p>

<p class="text">
 When we supply the input with AC power we are going to get an output with a DC power. Almost any industrial sensor, actuator or control device will operate either on
 <number>12V DC</number> or <number>24V DC</number>, its standardized to these two voltage rating.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In PLC we have input and output power supply, the Input PS feed with AC power <number>120/220V AC</number> or AC input voltage. Output PS provide a
 <number>12/24V</number> with <number>5A</number> of power.

 We place our power supply module into a PLC racks. PLC racks are the simple components that hold everything together. Or we call them expansion rack, we plug each
 component into a rack.

 Power supply comes in different sizes and power ratings depending on your application. Different sizes are going to reference current and be rated in
 <underline>amps</underline> or <underline>amperes</underline>.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  While the main power supply is the primary source of power for the PLC, there is usually a battery backup as well inside PLC. This will provide energy to the memory of
  the PLC in case of a power supply failure or power outage in general.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 The common current ratings for PLC's are anywhere from <number>2</number> to <number>10</number> amps for smaller systems and up to <number>50</number> amps for larger,
 more powerful controllers. The current rating will directly affect how much work your PLC system can actually do.

<p class="text">
 A PLC power supply is the workhorse of the PLC system. It converts your line voltage, <number>120</number> or <number>240</number> volts AC, to a lower DC voltage,
 commonly <number>24</number> volts DC. This DC voltage is then sent into the rack to power the rest of the PLC components.

<p class="text">
 If a PLC has <number>120/220V</number> AC input source then it sure has an internal power supply, which convert AC to DC, you don't have to use any external power
 supply.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image002.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Some PLCs doesn't have an internal power supply, so you have to provide <number>12/24V</number> power source with external power supply of <number>12/24V</number> DC
 power source.
</p>

<div class="text-box warning">
 <p>If your PLC has a <text>DC</text> input source and you provide it with <text>AC</text> source, then it will burn out immediately.</p>

 Every device needs an amount of current to operate if you provide it with less current it will not function properly, Each device is going to connect to PS has a maximum
 and normal current rating.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>If your device needs a current rating of <number>4</number> Amps then you have to choose a power supply with <number>5</number> Amp output, why ?</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 You have to add <number>25%</number> on device current rating. Because on device start up needs a maximum current rate usually the normal current value needs an
 additional <number>25%</number> value extra in order to start the device successfully without failure
</p>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  Device total current rating * 1.25 = power supply output <br />
  <number>4A</number> * <number>1.25</number> = <number>5A</number>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  Itâ€™s ok to choose power supply with a higher current rating but not ok to choose a higher voltage A higher current power supply doesn't harm your devices because they
  take the current it needs to operate , and you can provide these devices with the same current rate or an addition <number>25%</number> current rate <br />
  <number>5A</number> * <number>1.25</number> = <number>6.25amp</number>
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Voltage must match the exact device voltage rating And the current can be equal or more than the device rated current because the device will take the necessary current
 to operate
</p>

<div class="text-box warning">
 <p>A Higher voltage power supply output it will damage your device so you must provide these device with the same voltage they need only</p>

<p class="title-text green"># Question:</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">You have 4 devices each one need 5, 6, 4, 5 Amps how many current Amps that your power supply need to provide ?</p>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  <underline yellow>Solution:</underline> <br />
  Total current all devices <number>5</number> + <number>6</number> + <number>4</number> + <number>5</number> = <number>20Amps</number> - Now then add
  <number>25%</number> more <br />
  <number>20</number> * <number>1.25</number> = <number>25 Amps</number> <br />
  You need a power supply that can provide a <number>25 Amps</number> Current
