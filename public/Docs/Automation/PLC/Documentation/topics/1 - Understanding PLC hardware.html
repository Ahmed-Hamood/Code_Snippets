<p class="text">
 PLC is short for programming logic controller, it consist of a computer with several additional hardware pieces that are a part to it or you can be attach to it at any
 time.
</p>

<p class="title-text green">- Why PLC can we just use personal computer ?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 PLC is an industrial grade computer device designed which is used for automating/controlling production machines. PLC is a
 <tooltip desc="designed or improved to be hard-wearing or shock-resistant.">ruggedized</tooltip> computer that has been designed to tolerate harsh amd noisy industrial
 environments. That is the main difference compared to personal computer.
</p>

<p class="title-text green">- Where PLC is used ?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 PLC is commonly used to control motors, relays, fans, lights and other equipments in factories and industrial operations. You can find them in automotive manufacture and
 plants, food and beverage factories, packaging machines. Here other places or manufacture industrials that our PLC utilized.

<p class="title-text green">- What is the PLC purpose ?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 PLC helps you to automate a sequence of process efficiently, and it provides a flexible way to connect different components together with an application software.
</p>

<p class="text">
 PLCs have a leaner operating system that is intended mainly for processing inputs and outputs based on programmed logic. That means PLC will react much faster which is
 essential for many applications.

<p class="text">We are going to work with <underline>Siemens S7-1200 PLC</underline> and view its elements, so lets start.</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image008.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Our PLC has a <underline yellow>power supply</underline> with <number>120/220V</number> AC, this PLC has to be provided with <number>120V</number> or
 <number>220V</number> AC from your power source. Some PLCs provide a 24V DC, but this PLC has an internal power supply inside.
</p>

<div class="text-box warning">
 <p>If your PLC has a DC input source and you provide it with AC source, then it will burn out immediately.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Next beside power supply, we have <number>8</number> <underline yellow>digital inputs</underline> of <number>24V</number>, these inputs are digital controllers that
 provide a signal and process that using your algorithms and it will give you some outputs.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Below digital input, you will find some <underline yellow>input indicators</underline>, these LED indicators will tell you which input is <text green>on</text> or
 <text red>off</text>. You will see some green light in these indicators which indicate the input is <text green>on</text>, and if there is no light then it mean the
 input is <text red>off</text>.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Below we have <underline yellow>digital outputs</underline>, its a <number>6</number> of output relay type, relay is a coil which has a high current amps ratings.
 Generally PLC have two types one is transistor type and relay type. Relay type which has more current and capability than transistor type.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Above digital output, we have <underline yellow>output indicators</underline> similar to digital input LED, when outputs like light or motor are on you can see their
 status within these output indicators instead of the physical level.
</p>

<p class="text">
 On left side of PLC, we have <underline yellow>PLC status indicators</underline>, these indicators tells us either the PLC is <text green>running</text>,
 <text red>stop</text>, <text red>error</text> or <text orange>maint</text>. In run mode it will start executing the logic program that you give the PLC.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image007.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 here a close look of our inputs, starting with power supply section <number>L1</number> and <number>N</number>, the <number>N</number> symbol has an arrow goes down this
 means you have to supply the power as it mention <number>120-240V</number> AC
</p>

<p class="text">
 beside power supply input, we have two terminals <number>L+</number> and <number>M</number> they are the DC outputs which is <number>24VDC</number>, we will give you
 <number>24V</number> output from this PLC. We can use this <number>24V</number> for wiring out inputs.
</p>

<p class="text">After that we have our terminals inputs to connect your additional inputs, and also we have <number>2</number> analog inputs as well.</p>

<p class="text">
 on right side we have a memory card slot to store information about your PLC like values in your PLC program, it helps you to have a record of your process
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image009.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">Below PLC, we have our output terminal of the PLC, as you see we have <number>6</number> relay outputs</p>

<p class="text">
 Left we have communication status indicators, if your PLC is connected to an HMI or some other device, this indicators are just insure that the communications are just
 fine.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Also we have LAN interface, this PLC has a feature S7-1200, here you can program your PLC in a standard LAN cable, you just need to use your standard LAN cable to start
 programming your PLC.
