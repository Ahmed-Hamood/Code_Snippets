 PLC is short for programming logic controller, it consist of a computer with several additional hardware pieces that are a part to it or you can be attach to it at any
 time.

<p class="title-text green">- Why PLC can we just use personal computer ?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 PLC is an industrial grade computer device designed which is used for automating/controlling production machines. PLC is a
 <tooltip desc="designed or improved to be hard-wearing or shock-resistant.">ruggedized</tooltip> computer that has been designed to tolerate harsh amd noisy industrial
 environments. That is the main difference compared to personal computer.

<p class="title-text green">- Where PLC is used ?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 PLC is commonly used to control motors, relays, fans, lights and other equipments in factories and industrial operations. You can find them in automotive manufacture and
 plants, food and beverage factories, packaging machines. Here other places or manufacture industrials that our PLC utilized.

<p class="title-text green">- What is the PLC purpose ?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 PLC helps you to automate a sequence of process efficiently, and it provides a flexible way to connect different components together with an application software.
</p>

<p class="text">
 PLCs have a leaner operating system that is intended mainly for processing inputs and outputs based on programmed logic. That means PLC will react much faster which is
 essential for many applications.

 The PLC power supply converts a line voltage commonly <number>120/220V</number> AC into a usable <number>12/24V</number> DC, this DC voltage is used to power the rest of
 the PLC and components.
</p>

<p class="text">
 When we supply the input with AC power we are going to get an output with a DC power. Almost any industrial sensor, actuator or control device will operate either on
 <number>12V DC</number> or <number>24V DC</number>, its standardized to these two voltage rating.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In PLC we have input and output power supply, the Input PS feed with AC power <number>120/220V AC</number> or AC input voltage. Output PS provide a
 <number>12/24V</number> with <number>5A</number> of power.

 We place our power supply module into a PLC racks. PLC racks are the simple components that hold everything together. Or we call them expansion rack, we plug each
 component into a rack.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Power supply comes in different sizes and power ratings depending on your application. Different sizes are going to reference current and be rated in
 <underline>amps</underline> or <underline>amperes</underline>.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  While the main power supply is the primary source of power for the PLC, there is usually a battery backup as well inside PLC. This will provide energy to the memory of
  the PLC in case of a power supply failure or power outage in general.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 The common current ratings for PLC's are anywhere from <number>2</number> to <number>10</number> amps for smaller systems and up to <number>50</number> amps for larger,
 more powerful controllers. The current rating will directly affect how much work your PLC system can actually do.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image006.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 A PLC power supply is the workhorse of the PLC system. It converts your line voltage, <number>120</number> or <number>240</number> volts AC, to a lower DC voltage,
 commonly <number>24</number> volts DC. This DC voltage is then sent into the rack to power the rest of the PLC components.

 If a PLC has <number>120/220V</number> AC input source then it sure has an internal power supply, which convert AC to DC, you don't have to use any external power

 Some PLCs doesn't have an internal power supply, so you have to provide <number>12/24V</number> power source with external power supply of <number>12/24V</number> DC

<p class="text">
 You have to add <number>25%</number> on device current rating. Because on device start up needs a maximum current rate usually the normal current value needs an

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  Itâ€™s ok to choose power supply with a higher current rating but not ok to choose a higher voltage A higher current power supply doesn't harm your devices because they

  Total current all devices <number>5</number> + <number>6</number> + <number>4</number> + <number>5</number> = <number>20Amps</number> - Now then add <number>25%</number> more <br />
