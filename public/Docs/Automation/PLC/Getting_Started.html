 PLC or programmable logic controller its a device that is used to wire machines or equipment like sensors/switches/motors together, and control them by writing
 algorithms inside it. It will control whatever signal connected to it.

 A programmable logic controller (PLC) is a digital computer used to automate typically industrial electromechanical processes, such as machinery control on factory
 assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.

<p class="text">
 Small PLC computer can control smaller machines such as <tooltip image="/img/image002.PNG" desc="">conveyors</tooltip> and motors. It has less functionality and it
 contains enough memory to store ladder logic programs for monitoring local I/O devices.

<p class="title-text green">Medium PLC</p>

<p class="text">
 A medium PLC is a computer that can control a large machines such as assembly lines and motors it has more functionality than small PLC, it includes a large memory size
 expanded communication ports, higher processing speeds, and additional input/output devices.
</p>

<p class="title-text green">Large PLC</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 A large PLC is a computer that can control very large machines such as whole building blocks or power-producing turbines. It has more functionality than previous PLCs
 due to its high memory in size, expand communication ports, high processing speed and additional input/output devices.

<p class="title-text green">Fixed/Integrated/Compact PLC</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 Compact PLC is a small, micros=processor controller designed to handle small automation tasks. It has a build-in primary components attached to it, like inputs, outputs,
 power supply, processing unit, and terminals or connectors that link with devices such as sensors and switches.
</p>

<p class="text">
 When you buy Compact PLCs, you will notice that the input section and the output sections of the PLC are integrated into the micro-controller itself. This means that
 every type of output or input is fixed and is determined by the manufacturer.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>Furthermore, the number of inputs and outputs may not be expanded in this type of PLC.</p>
</div>

<p class="title-text green">Modular PLC</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 modular PLC is a type that allows multiple expansions of the PLC system through the use of modules. Modules give the programmable logic controller additional features
 like increased number of I/O units, and they are usually easier to use because each component is independent of each other.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The power supply, CPU, communications module, Input/Output module are all separate to the actual micro-controller so you have to manually connect them to each other to
 create your PLC control system. You buy components separately depend on your requirement.
</p>

<p class="text">
 A type of modular PLC is the rack-mounted or rack mount PLC. In a rack mount PLC, the communications module of the PLC resides in the rack itself, so all connections are
 centralized.

<p class="text">
 PLC Input/Output modules are interfaces that connects the PLC-CPU System/Program to the outside world or to
 <tooltip desc="connect to switches, sensors, valves, Relays and Contactor">machines</tooltip>. You need to understand how you get information into my PLC and how I
 control things a round me.
</p>

<p class="text">
 When you buy a PLC it typically comes with few channels of inputs and outputs, sometimes it comes with both analog and digital input/output. There are some PLC with I/O
 interface, these types of PLC called module PLCs, you need to add on I/O modules.
</p>

<p class="text">
 These I/O modules come in different shapes and sizes depend on the type of PLC and the manufacture that is behind it. There are a general modules that handle simple
 digital inputs and digital outputs and there are more specialized modules like

When the junction is heated or cooled, a small voltage is generated in the electrical circuit of the thermocouple which can be measured, and this corresponds to temperature"
  >thermocouple signal</tooltip

 and high speed inputs that have to be read at a much higher frequency that a typical module can handle.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>We also have a generic modules that can be attached to a several types of PLCs thru ethernet communication protocols</p>
</div>
 

<p class="text">
 PLC Input/Output modules is responsible for taking signals from inputs like switches or sensors, and use these signal to output signal that will start machines like
 <underline yellow>motor starter</underline>, <underline yellow>valves</underline>, <underline yellow>lights</underline>, <underline yellow>Relays</underline> and
 <underline yellow>Contactor</underline>.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  In a PLC system there will usually be dedicated modules for inputs and dedicated modules for outputs. An input module detects the status of input signals such as push
  button, switches, temperature sensors, etc... An output module controls devices such as relays, motor starters, lights, etc.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Signals comes into out PLC from various devices such as switches, buttons and instruments (sensors). These will tell the PLC what is happening within the process. The
 PLC uses program to decide what actions to take, when and how in controlling the devices attached to it, and thus governing the greater process.
</p>

<p class="text">As the signals come in from switches or sensors, the more signal must go out to control devices such as pumps, drives, heaters, valves and etc.</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">- There are two types of signals</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Digital signals</underline>: Digital inputs a discrete input devices like buttons, pressure switches amd flow switches sends a boolean type signal into
 the PLC the values is considered either:
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li>One or Zero</li>
  <li>On or Off</li>
  <li>True or False</li>
  <li>Closed or Oen</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Also we have digital output devices like relays, valve actuators and single speed pumps rely on a discrete from the PLC to energize them, also digital output work in a
 boolean terms.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Analog signals</underline>: Analog input devices comes in a range expressing various levels of precision, like <underline>potentiometer</underline>,
 <underline>RTD's</underline> and <underline>pH</underline> sensors send a
 <tooltip desc="capable of or inclined to resistance; resisting. Electricity.">resistive</tooltip> or voltage signal to PLC. Typical analog signals include but are by no
 mean limited to the following.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li>4-20mA</li>
  <li>4.00-20.00mA</li>
  <li>0-5 VDC</li>
  <li>(-10)-(+10) VDC</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>These analog signals can work with variable frequency, mostly you gonna work with milli-amps signals or DC voltages.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Also analog output devices like heater coils, motor drives nad variable speed dosing pumps rely on an analog signal from the PLC to control their heat, speed.
