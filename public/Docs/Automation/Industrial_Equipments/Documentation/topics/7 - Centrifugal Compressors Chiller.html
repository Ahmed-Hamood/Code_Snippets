<p class="text">The compressor is the driving/pushing force of the refrigerant around he system. Our compressor is mounted on the top of the chiller as you see below.</p>

<p class="text">
 The centrifugal compressor is basically a radial flow roto-dynamic fluid machine that primarily uses air as the working fluid and increases the total internal energy of
 the fluid inside by using mechanical energy (transferred to the machine from an outside source), typically in the form of increased static pressure head.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Our compressor is fed from the <underline yellow>suction line</underline> off the evaporator which carry our heated refrigerant with heat that have been collected from
 the building.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant boils in the evaporator and is sucked into the suction line as a low pressure, slightly superheated vapour. As it enters the compressor is first passes
 through the vane guides.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image083.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Our vane guides allow refrigerant to flow into the compressor, our refrigerant enters the compressor body It gets spun around at high velocity and fly's off, collecting
 in the volute loop.
</p>

<p class="text">
 As it enters the volute (the <tooltip image="/img/image084.png" desc="">spiral shape</tooltip> of increasing diameter around the perimeter) it slows down and increases
 in pressure. That pressure forces the prior refrigerant out of the volute and down into the condenser with high temperature refrigerant.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>The reason that high temperature is important is because heat flows from hot to cold. We need the chiller to get rid of the buildings unwanted heat.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 As you see above, a thermal image of a centrifugal compressor on a chiller. The cool, low pressure refrigerant entering into the compressor but as it leaves through the
 volute and discharge line its temperature has increased.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The compressor is going to compress the refrigerant particles together which is going to make it highly energetic, and increases the temperature. Think of it as packing
 a lot of thermal energy into a smaller space. That is absolutely key to the operation of a chiller.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image012.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Here we press or push the lid downwards, the particles become more closely packed and energized, there’s a lot of collisions occurring between the particles.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>If you've ever used a bike pump you'll know that the pump will become hot as you force the air into the inner tube.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 If you remember, the condenser water circuit flows between the condenser and the cooling tower. The cooling tower disperses the heat into the atmosphere. The condenser
 water leaves the condenser at around <number>32C</number> and returns at around <number>27C</number> to pickup more heat.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Because heat flows from hot to cold, that means the refrigerant coming out of the compressor needs to be hotter than the returning condenser water. The only way to do
 that is to compress the refrigerant to raise the temperature.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This will get the thermal energy into a much denser form which makes it easier to transfer over. The higher the temperature difference, the easier it is to transfer
 thermal energy.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  If the refrigerant entering into the condenser was the same temperature as the returning condenser water, the chiller wouldn’t reject any heat so it wouldn’t work. The
  building will overheat and shut down.
 </p>

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant flows in through the suction line off the evaporator and sucked into the impeller which rotates, here our refrigerant rotates and is
 <tooltip desc="throw off in range, cast/thrown away">flung off</tooltip>,which mean its pushed away by the impeller blades.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image085.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Then our refrigerant hits the diffuser, which is a small gap running around the perimeter, between the compression chamber and the volute. The diffuser slows the high
 velocity refrigerant particles down and as that occurs it will transform the velocity into pressure.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image086.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant builds up in the volute as you see below, and the constant force of the next incoming refrigerant pushes the refrigerant out through the discharge line
 and into the condenser.
</p>

<p class="title-text green">Working of Centrifugal Compressor</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 Our refrigerant enters the compressor, the refrigerant strikes the impeller, which contains multiple radial blades rotating with the rotation of the impeller.
</p>

<p class="text">
 As the refrigerant strikes the impeller blades, the refrigerant pushes to the centre of the impeller by centrifugal force. The impeller blades, after striking of
 refrigerant provide kinetic energy to the refrigerant which increases the velocity of the refrigerant.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant enters into the diffuser area after passing through the impeller. This diffuser contains multiple stationary vanes. As soon as the refrigerant enters the
 diffuser area, its speed or velocity of flow of the refrigerant starts to decrease.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Now, according to Bernoulli’s principle, the velocity square is inversely proportional to pressure. The diffuser converts this increased velocity of the refrigerant into
 pressure energy before the refrigerant is drawn into the centre of impeller. This increase in the impeller’s pressure under most conditions will be roughly equal to the
 increase in diffuser pressure.

<p class="text">
 The impeller will come in different diameter sizes. This variation occurs because the different refrigerants have different molecular weights. Different capacity
 chillers will require different sized lift or head pressure as well as the mass flow rate of the refrigerant through the chiller.
</p>

<p class="text">
 When the impeller spins, its going to have an angular velocity. If you spin something, it wan’t to move away from the centre as far as possible. Think of spinning a rock
 attached to some string. It moves outward. This is centrifugal force, which is actually just a combination of forces.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In the above illustration we’ve compared some different sized impellers. This calculates the centrifugal force as well as the tangent velocity. Check the video for
 detailed work through of these calculations.

<p class="sub-title">4. How much work is done by the compressor ?</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->

<p class="text">
 Work (W) can calculate that. It's the difference in enthalpy between suction line and the discharge line, multiplied by the mass flow rate of the refrigerant.
