<p class="text">
 Refrigerant is a fluid that we can easily boiled from liquid into a vapour, and also be condensed from a vapour back into a liquid, then this need to occur again and
 again without failure as you see below

 Refrigerant fluid could be water that would work and its used in

</p>

<p class="text">
 These Refrigerant have extremely low boiling points compared to water as you see above. They need very little heat in order to boil and evaporate into vapor, this mean
 this type of Refrigerant can extract heat more rapidly/quickly.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In order to boil this type of Refrigerant we need only te room temperature t bil these and take the heat away from the room and

 The first step, we use the compressor to push the Refrigerant around the system, our compressor is the driving force. We are going to look at basic

<p class="text">
 <text>B</text> - Our compressor is pulling the refrigerant in, and then the compressor rapidly compresses it. This forces the refrigerant molecules together, so the same
 amount of molecules fit into a smaller space, this increases the collision rate of the molecules because they are all constantly bouncing around.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image012.gif" alt="image" />

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>Same number of molecules - smaller volume - higher collision rate</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 As molecules collide they convert their energy into heat at the same time all the energy that is put in by the compressor is converted into internal energy within the
 refrigerant.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <text>C</text> - This result in the refrigerant become high in temperature because the pressure increases. The refrigerant is exhausted out of the compressor thru

<p class="sub-title">3. The Condenser</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">Now, our refrigerant of high pressure and temperature with superheated vapour comes out of the compressor a round into the Condenser</p>

<p class="text">
 The Condenser is where all the unwanted heat is rejected out into the atmosphere this include all the heat from the building as well as the heat from the compressor.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image018.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 When the refrigerant enters the Condenser, it need to be in higher temperature than the air around it in order for the heat to transfer, the greater the temperature
 difference the easier the heat transfer would be.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant enters as a super-heated vapour at high temperature and high pressure, and it passes along the tubes of the Condenser, fans will blow air a cross the
 Condenser to remove the heat or to cool it down.
</p>

<p class="text">
 As the air blow cross the tube it removes the thermal energy from the refrigerant, as the refrigerant gives up this heat it will condense into a liquid so by the time
 the refrigerant leaves the Condenser it will be completely saturated liquid with high pressure and medium temperature which a slightly cooler, and its

 will decrease.
</p>

<p class="text">Next, our refrigerant passes its way from the Condenser a round into the expansion device</p>

<p class="sub-title">4. Thermal Expansion Valve</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 The Thermal Expansion Valve passes refrigerant into the evaporator, our expansion valve uses a Capillary bulb to control the flow thru the valve depending on the
 temperature at the outlet of the evaporator.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image019.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Our expansion valve is a bit like a spray nozzle it has high pressure on one side within bottle and there's a low pressure side just pass the nozzle when the trigger
 squeezed it lets the fluid pass and this will be a mixture of liquid and vapor.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image020.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">As the refrigerant passes thru the expansion valve the refrigerant will expand going into the evaporator at lower pressure with lower temperature.</p>

<p class="text">Our refrigerant will leave the expansion valve and at a low pressure and temperature, it will now heads straight into the evaporator.</p>

<p class="sub-title">5. The Evaporator</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 The Evaporator receives the refrigerant and the fan blows the warm air a cross the coils, the temperature of the air must be higher than the temperature of the cool refrigerant
 and this allows it to absorb more energy and to boil the refrigerant completely into a vapor.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image019.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant leaves as a saturated vapor at a low pressure and temperature only changes slightly because its on a phase where a liquid changes into a vapour.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The thermal energy is being used to break the bonds between the molecules but their enthalpy and entropy will increase and this is where the energy is going.
