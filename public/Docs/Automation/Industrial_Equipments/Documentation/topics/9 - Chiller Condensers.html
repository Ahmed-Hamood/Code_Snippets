<p class="text">
 Te condenser is located between the the compressor and the expansion valve as you see below. Here our high pressure and high temperature refrigerant vapour enters the
 condenser and liquid refrigerant exits the condenser.

 Our condenser is usually not insulated all unwanted heat that comes from the condenser is gonna be rejected out to atmosphere or room not a big deal because the room is
 being cooled by outside ambient air, then it doesn't matter. If u
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>if the plant room is being cooled by refrigeration as well, then it makes perfect sense to insulate this and reject all the heat out into the building</p>
</div>

<img id="image" path="/img/image049.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The unwanted heat of the building enters the evaporator and the refrigerant takes this to the compressor to pack it tightly together. That heat is then transported
 through the compressor and over into the condenser.
</p>

<p class="text">The condenser then picks up that heat, and transfers it from the refrigerant and into the water which circulates around the condenser water loop.</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>The refrigerant and water never meet or mix, they are always kept separated by a metal wall, only heat transfers between them.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Once the condenser water has cooled down, it returns then at a much cooler temperature ready to pick up more heat from the condenser again. The condenser water is
 flowing out at about <number>32</number> degrees Celsius (<number>90</number> degrees Fahrenheit), and it’s returning at <number>27</number> degrees Celsius (<number
  >81</number
 >
 degrees Fahrenheit).

<p class="text">
 The condenser outer shell, inside the shell we got some tubes which run along from one end to another. Our tubes contains the condenser water, as you see below our
 condenser has two holes one outlet and inlet and water goes thru inlet and turn as U path and comes out thru the outlet.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image107.PNG" alt="image" />

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  Depending on the design the condenser water will either flow straight through all the tubes or it will flow in through half of them and then do a U turn and come back
  out the same end. This is to increase efficiency and reduce the size.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 The tubes contain the condenser water. On the outside of the tubes is the refrigerant which is coming from the compressor. The two fluids are always separated by the
 tube wall. They're completely isolated from each other.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The condenser water is coming from the cooling tower, into the condenser via the inlet on the “water box” (The end cover). The water box section is removable is taken
 off for cleaning of the tubes.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image108.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The condenser water flows through the tubes to the very end, hits the other water box at the end, does a 180 degree turn, comes back through the tubes and back out the
 first water box. There's a baffle (metal separation) between the inlet and outlet on the first water box.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Hot compressed refrigerant is going to come out of the compressor and start to fill this void within the condenser. The hot refrigerant vapour will fill the space
 between the tubes containing the condenser water.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image109.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 As the hot refrigerant comes into contact with the cooler surface of the condenser tubes, the refrigerant is going to condense into a liquid on the tubes surface. As it
 does so the heat will transfer through the tube wall and into the refrigerant.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image113.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The condenser water runs through the condenser, hits the end water box, does a 180 degree turn and comes back through, still picking up the last heat it can to the
 maximum efficiency.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Meanwhile the liquid refrigerant collects as a liquid at the bottom of the condenser. It will leave here through the bottom and flows into the expansion valve. The
 heated condenser water will now head off to the cooling tower.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  When the refrigerant exits the compressor and heads down into the condenser, it needs to be at a much higher temperature than the return (incoming) condenser water
  that’s coming back from the cooling tower. The condenser water enters at around <number>27°C</number> (<number>81°F</number>) so the refrigerant needs to be a greater
  temperature than this.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="text-box warning">
 <p>
  If the refrigerant is the same temperature as this return condenser water then the chiller will not be able to reject any heat that’s been picked up in the building,
  and so the building will be unable to cool down.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Our cooling tower rejects heat from the condenser water, if water temperature return is the same E.g. if it’s going up at <number>32</number> degrees Celsius, and the
 cooling tower is unable to reject this heat, (perhaps there is recirculation happening or the water is just dumping instead of spraying, or there’s a problem with the
 baffles) and the water is just returning straight back down into the condenser, then you will not be able to reject any heat from the compressor and it will eventually
 cause the chiller to trip on high pressure.

<p class="text">
 You can see two thermal images of a chiller. The left image in the discharge line coming out of the compressor, the centrifugal compressor is on the top and the hot
 compressed refrigerant is exiting via the discharge line, into the condenser. You can see that it’s going to be around <number>55</number> degrees celsius.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The right thermal image, shows the inlet and outlet of the condenser of the chiller. You can see that the water is coming back from the cooling tower at around 17.6
 degrees Celsius and it’s exiting at <number>25.9</number> degrees Celsius to head back up to the cooling tower.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  You should have noticed that these figures are a slightly different temperature range than in the schematic which we were looking at earlier. That’s just because the
  schematic is showing design figures at a high loading, whereas this is actual figures from a lower loading. There will always be a difference between design and actual.
  That depends on the cooling load on the chiller and the outside ambient temperature.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Our condenser water in the cooling tower is sprayed through the cooling tower to get rid of that heat to reject and dissipate it into the atmosphere this is an open
 system whereas this loop here is a closed system this loop here is an open system so the water is sprayed and air and dirt can get into this system. And what comes into
 this system gets sent down into the condenser.
</p>

<p class="text">
 There are two types of cooling towers used, open circuit and closed circuits. Open circuits are the most common, they spray the hot condenser water into the ambient air
 which effectivly cools the water down using the latent heat of evaporation.
</p>

<p class="text">
 We can have an issue with the condenser water pipework and the condenser heat exchanger known as <underline yellow>fouling occurring</underline>. Where the Dirt and other particles will collect on
 the surfaces of the pipes and heat exchanger and will form a layer of insulation.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This build-up is basically small deposits of salt, scale, dirt, mineral build-up and also bacterial growth. As I said it insulates the pipe which reduces the chillers
 efficiency and cooling capacity. This can be treated with a rigorous chemical dosing regime.

<p class="text">
 Unfortunately this by itself will not be enough to stop it, it will just be enough to reduce it or mitigate it. Alternatively, you can get some specialists to come in
 and clean it off with jet brush.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  On the chiller discharge and liquid line we’re going to find two large valves. These can be shut (during maintenance) and used to isolate all the refrigerant within the
  condenser. So if you need to take this apart the refrigerant can all be pumped and moved into the condenser and these can be sealed to keep all that refrigerant inside.
  DO NOT TOUCH THESE UNLESS AUTHORISED
