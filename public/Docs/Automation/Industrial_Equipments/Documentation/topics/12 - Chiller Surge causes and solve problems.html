<p class="text">
 As we know our compressor is the diving force of our refrigerant a round the chiller. Our refrigerant leaves the compress at high pressure and temperature thru the
 discharge line and flow into the condenser.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Our refrigerant flows from condenser into the expansion valve and into the evaporator where it will be pull into the compressor again via the suction line.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The cycle repeats constantly to allow the chiller to dump the unwanted heat from the evaporator, which was collected from the building, and move this over to the
 condenser so it can be sent off to the cooling towers.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The compressor is driven by an electrical motor which rotates and our internal impellers rotates and sucks the refrigerant in from the evaporator via the suction line.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The impeller blades imparts and angular velocity onto the refrigerant particles causing them to fly off the end of the blades in all directions at very high velocity.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant flies off the impeller blades it collects into the volute which is a channel surrounding the compressor in a spiral shape which enlarges in diameter
 along itâ€™s length.

<p class="text">
 You can see the flow path from the evaporator through the suction line into the compressor, which is rotating and pushing the refrigerant out through the discharge line
 and into the condenser. It flows this way because the compressor causes a pressure difference across the impeller.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The low pressure side is on the evaporator side, where it is sucking the refrigerant in. The high pressure side is is after the compressor in the condenser, where the
  refrigerant is being forced into. The pressure builds up in the discharge line and the condenser.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Each compressor only can handle certain amount of pressure difference. Each chiller provide a certain amount of pressure rating. When our compressor takes the
 refrigerant at low pressure from the evaporator.
</p>

<p class="text">
 After that our compressor lift the refrigerant increasing pressure thru into the condenser. Again we take the refrigerant at low pressure from evaporator, and increasing
 (lifting it) it through use of the compressor and forcing it into the condenser as a higher pressure.
