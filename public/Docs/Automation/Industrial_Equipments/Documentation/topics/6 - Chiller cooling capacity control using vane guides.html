<p class="main-title">Chiller cooling capacity control using vane guides</p>
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 Lets say our chiller system the amount of refrigerant that flows internally is not controlled, the amount of cooling generated is too much and too much heat been
 removed, then too much chilled or cold water this will cause the chiller to freeze.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>Too much refrigerant passes thru compressor means maximum cooling, and less refrigerant mean minimum cooling.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 If the chiller freezes then its gonna cause problem for your chiller components, this will result in
 <tooltip
  desc=" fatigue is the initiation and propagation of cracks in a material due to cyclic loading. Once a fatigue crack has initiated, it grows a small amount with each loading cycle, typically producing striations on some parts of the fracture surface."
  >material fatigue</tooltip

</p>

<p class="text">
 As you know our chiller produce chilled water by removing the thermal energy from the water. Our chiller water is looping thru the evaporator, the chilled water travel
 thru the building and then come back to the evaporator with heat that has been collected from the building.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Here we need to make sure that our chilled water cooling amount need to vary to match the load, otherwise too much heat can be removed and this will cause the chiller to
 freeze.

  To control chiller cooling capacity, we use a method within centrifugal compressors, we use <underline yellow>vane guides</underline>. The vane guides sit in the flow
  path of the refrigerant. Its located between the suction line (from evaporator) and the compressor.
 </p>

 The vane guides are a triangular and multiple vane guides sit radially in the cross sectional area. Our vane guides can be controlled and
 <tooltip desc="to regulate, adjust, or adapt to the proper degree">modulate</tooltip> their position between fully open and fully closed.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The vanes are <tooltip desc="in a way that is connected with the qualities of an object that affect the way it moves through the air.">aerodynamically</tooltip> profiled
 to minimize the pressure drop across them from the flow of refrigerant.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The purpose of these vane guides is to change the flow direction of the refrigerant. Change in direction means the refrigerant will hit the compressor impeller at a
 different angle. The lesser the angle, the less <tooltip desc="strength or force gained by motion ">momentum</tooltip> the impeller will
 <tooltip desc="will give; make">impart</tooltip> of the refrigerant.

<p class="title-text green">When Vanes are Fully Open</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text"><mark>When the vanes are fully open the refrigerant simply passes straight over them, this occurs at full capacity to provide maximum cooling</mark>.</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">When Vanes either partly or fully closed</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 <mark
  >When the vanes modulate their position and are either partly or fully closed, the refrigerant hits into the vane guide which in turn changes the direction it was
  flowing in which mean less capacity to provide minimum cooling.</mark

</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The more closed the vane guide, the greater the angle of entry into the impeller. If the angle of entry is changed, then the refrigerant flows slower through the
  compressor and volute, this reduces the kinetic energy and pressure.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 You can imagine this like placing your hand out flat, through the window of a moving car. As you move the angle of your hand, you will feel the air flow over the top or
 bottom of your hand and there will be a resulting force pushing against your hand depending on its angle.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The position of the vane guides can be adjusted, <mark bold>typically based on the leaving water temperature of in the evaporator.</mark> There are many methods used to change the
 position, some use oil pressure from the lubrication system, others will with a belt driven motor, a gear ratio.
