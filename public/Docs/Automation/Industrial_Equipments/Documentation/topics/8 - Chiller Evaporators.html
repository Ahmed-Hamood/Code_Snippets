<p class="text">
 As we know the chilled water leaves the evaporator and pumped a round the building, this pumped chilled water goes into the
 <underline yellow>AHU (Air Handling Units)</underline> and collected all the unwanted heat from the building.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image049.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Fans within Air Handling Units force the warm room air across a heat exchanger or coils containing the chilled water, this will transfer heat into the cold chilled water
 pipe and pass a cold air thru it.
</p>

<p class="text">
 As the warm air passes thru the chilled water, the air will cool down and the chilled water inside the pipe will heat up, the warm water will flow back to the chiller
 evaporator, then the collected heat will be transferred from the water and into the refrigerant carry it into the compressor then to condenser within the chiller.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Our evaporator is a cylinder between the expansion valve and suction line (which goes into compressor). The chillers evaporator is usually insulated and covered with
 heavy black foam insulation called <green>a vinyl nitrate polymer type insulation</green>.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image092.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 This black cover foam help to keep the cooling energy inside the evaporator without any waste, our evaporator produce chilled water which is very expensive to produce so
 we want to make sure that all the cooling energy produced gets sent out around the building to collect all the unwanted heat then flow back to get rid of it.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>evaporator must be isolated and we don't want the cooling energy go to waste by picking up heat from the plant room where the chiller is located.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Typically the insulation on the evaporator is going to be a vinyl nitrate polymer type insulation. It will be around <number>19</number> milometers thick,
 <number>3/4</number> of an inch, something like this

<p class="text">
 The evaporator is a shell and cylinder design, with tubes inside of it. Our refrigerant is collected inside the evaporator shell, and Inside our evaporator we have tubes
 or copper/metal pipes where the chilled water pass thru.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image093.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant in shell cylinder and water thru the copper/metal tubes (pipes) never meet or mix as you see below, they are always separated by the metal wall of the
 tube and only the heat transfers between these.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image094.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The tubes run along the length of the evaporator and the chilled water flows inside these tubes. The refrigerant sits outside the tubes and is in contact with the tubes
 surface.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The refrigerant enters through the bottom as liquid from the expansion valve. The refrigerant has an extremely low boiling point and the heat of the incoming (warm)
 chilled water from pipes is around <number>12°</number> C which will cause the refrigerant to boil off into a vapour.
</p>

<p class="text">
 As the refrigerant boils off, it carry’s away the unwanted heat from the incoming chilled water from pipes/tubes. All the heated water thru the pipe/tube is given up to
 the refrigerant, so it just transfers that heat through the metal tube wall and into the refrigerant.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Our refrigerant as liquid at the bottom picks up the heat from the pipe/tube, which will cause the refrigerant to boil and as liquid refrigerant picks up the heat it
 evaporators into vapour and heads off towards the suction line and into the compressor..
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The chilled water enters the evaporator, having collected the unwanted heat of the building, at around <number>12°</number> C (<number>53.6°</number> F) flows through
  the evaporator giving up it’s heat and then leaves cooler at around <number>6°</number> C (42.8° F).

<p class="text">
 To make sure that our refrigerant does not leak inside the evaporator shell, we close or weld it with metal plate on each end. As you see below our plate is drilled to
 allow the chilled water tubes to pass through.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image095.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Our copper material tubes are not welded to the plate though, our tube slide into these holes to fit in, the tubes are inserted fairly loosely and a toll is inserted and
 expands the pipe diameter to create a perfect seal between the tube.

<p class="text">
 At Evaporator both ends we install some <tooltip image="/img/image097.png" desc="">dome shape</tooltip> metal plates known as water boxes. Below we have two water boxes,
 One side has two holes separated by a metal plate One hole is for the incoming chilled water, the other hole is for the outgoing chilled water.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image098.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The metal plate between the holes is known as a baffle it’s only purpose is to keep the supply and return flow rates separated. Although some heat will transfer between
 the two.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The shell, water boxes and metal plate (baffle) are usually made from carbon steel. They’ll be built to a certain standard, depending on what country you’re in, to
  withhold a certain amount of pressure. They generally take a giant sheet of carbon steel and roll this to form a pipe shape and then weld along the seam to form the
  shell.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 You may have different types of plates in one end, which does not have the baffle in between. This simply channels the water so it will hit this, turn 180 degrees and
 flow back into some more tubes and then out the same side it came in. This makes the chiller more efficient and more compact.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image100.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The water boxes depend on how many times the water passes through the evaporator. An evaporator is often referred to as the number of passes which they have.
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">One Pass</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 Here our evaporator has one pass this mean that the chilled water simply enters one side flows all the way through the tubes, and into the water box on the other end,
 then leaves the other end.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image101.gif" alt="image" />

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">Two Passes</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 You could have a two-pass evaporator, where the chilled water enters the first water box as you see on the right we have a baffle or metal separation. it then passes
 through the tubes, into the end water box on the left, which does not have a baffle, it does a <number>180</number> turn and continues out through the first water box
 again.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image102.gif" alt="image" />

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">Three Passes</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 Here a three-pass evaporator where the chilled water enters into the first water box as you see on the right we have a baffle or metal separation. it’s channelled
 through the tubes into the water box at the other end which has a baffle also.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image103.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 That channels it through some other tubes into the first water box, the baffle channels that once again back to the secondary water box where it can exit.

<p class="sub-title">4. Evaporator water tubes</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 The tubes are made from copper ally or sometime they're made from stainless steel, that all depends on what the water is on the other side and whether it will corrode
 the material. Copper is generally used for commercial office buildings.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image099.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 There is two holes on the side of the evaporator, these are sight glasses that allow you to see whats inside the evaporator. You can see thru them the tubes as you see
 below.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image104.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">If you notice some of the tubes surface is smooth, and other tubes have these ridges (also called fins) all the way along them.</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image105.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 These fins increase the surface area of the tube, that means more heat can transfer out of the chilled water and into the refrigerant. This means also that the chiller
 is more efficient and smaller.
