<p class="main-title">Basic Refrigeration cycle</p>
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 The Refrigeration is a fluid passing around length of pipe, the pipe runs between four main components. The fluid Refrigeration come in a canister or cylinder called
 <text>R134A</text> it a common Refrigerant.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Inside the canister contains of as a compressed refrigerant gas is stored inside a canister, and this compressed gas is injected into our refrigerant cycle system which
 will flow thru all components as you see below.
</p>

<p class="text">
 We have a building with offices and homes that need a split air conditioning unit. We need to collect all the heat ar round the room and dump it outside, this whats we
 are going to do with this refrigerant system.
</p>

<p class="text">
 With these components we are going to change the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant, and thats how cooling and heating is produced. The following four main
 components in the refrigerant system are essential that every system has in order to work, let start.

<p class="sub-title">Stage 1 - The Compressor</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">Our refrigerant enters the compressor as a low-pressure warm gas, and after compressing it leaves as a high pressure hot gas</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image022.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The compressor when you compress a fluid the volume decreases and all the molecules in there get pushed closer together the quantity still the same its just more
 compact, when this happen it causes the temperature to increase and also the pressure increase.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This forces the refrigerant molecules together, so the same amount of molecules fit into a smaller space, this increases the collision rate of the molecules because they
 are all constantly bouncing around.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image012.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 As molecules collide they convert their energy into heat at the same time all the energy that is put in by the compressor is converted into internal energy within the
 refrigerant.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image010.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 This result in the refrigerant become high in temperature because the pressure increases. The refrigerant is exhausted out of the compressor thru discharge valve.

<p class="sub-title">Stage 2 - The Condenser</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 In order the refrigeration cycle to work you must be able to dump heat somewhere, the outside air must be cooler than the surface temperature of the pipe on the
 condenser.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  If the pipe surface temperature and the air around the Condenser are the same temperature, then it won't be able to dump any heat, so you would not able to cool the
  room down.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 to ensure the pipe is hotter than the air a round it, the refrigerant is compressed to a high pressure which obviously increases its temperature, which this allow heat
 to be projected out of the condenser.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image018.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 At the condenser Stage the refrigerant enters the condenser from the compressor as a high pressure hot-gas. It passes thru coils of pipes as you see above, to loses it
 temperature and cool down.
</p>

<p class="text">
 As it cools down it begins to condense it turn from a gas or vapour into a saturated warm liquid with a regular/medium temperature and still at a high pressure and
 regular temperature liquid.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Our condenser consist of fins which they are a sheet of metal that touche the pipe and that allows heat from the pipe to be carried away off into these conduction fins.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image023.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Also behind this condense coli we have a fan as it rotates or spin is picking up heat from the condenser pipe thru these fins and off the pipe allowing the heat to be
 dumped our of the system this method called
 <tooltip desc="Convection is the process of heat transfer by the bulk movement of molecules within fluids such as gases and liquids. ">convection</tooltip>

<p class="sub-title">Stage 3 - Expansion valve</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 In the expansion valve our refrigerant enters from the condenser as high-pressure with regular/medium temperature liquid. The valve regulates the flow of the refrigerant
 into the evaporator.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Inside the expansion valve body we have something called the
 <tooltip
  desc="Diaphragm valves are bi-directional, on-off throttle valves. They are used to control fluid flow by regulating the area with which media can enter and exit the valve, effectively changing its speed and velocity."
  >diaphragm</tooltip
 >. Our is connected to a thermal bulb at the exit of evaporator and its connected by a capillary thin tube
</p>

<p class="text">
 The thermal bulb sits on the exit of the evaporator that monitors the leaving refrigerant, it controls the sensing thermal bulb by expanding or contract depend on
 refrigerant pressure in <tooltip image="/img/image025.png" desc="">capsule</tooltip> will travel along the
 <tooltip image="/img/image026.png" desc="">capillary</tooltip>.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image027.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The expansion valve restrict the flow there will be less refrigerant on the exit of valve, this allow molecules of the refrigerant to expand and to move further a part
 which allow their temperature to drop and also the pressure of the refrigerant will become low.
</p>

<p class="text">The refrigerant leaves the expansion valve as a low pressure and cold liquid.</p>

<p class="sub-title">Stage 4 - The Evaporator</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 This is the last Stage of the refrigerant system cycle, here the refrigerant enters as low pressure cold liquid passes thru the coil which is similar to condenser.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image024.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Here we use the fan to blow the warm air across the coils, this allows the air to be cooled by the cold refrigerant within the pipe and also allows the refrigerant to
 pick up heat and carry it away towards the condenser to be dumped later thru the cycle.
</p>

<p class="text">
 our refrigerant after passing the coil will being to boil and it will Evaporator from a liquid into a gas, it does this because the boiling point of refrigerant is very
 low <text>R134A</text> which <number>-23</number> deg
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image028.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 this low pressure warm gas will be sucked back into the compressor where the refrigeration cycle will start again, and it pick the heat that comes from the evaporator will be dumped out off the Condenser
