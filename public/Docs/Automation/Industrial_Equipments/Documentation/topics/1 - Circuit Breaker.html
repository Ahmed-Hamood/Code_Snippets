<p class="text">
 A circuit breaker is an automatically or manually operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current from an
 overload or short circuit.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>You will find a circuit breaker in every automation control panel</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 The circuit breaker is a switching device which also offers protection by tripping and cutting off the supply to load in case of fault. Its like fuse but in circuit
 breaker it will only trip so we can turn on again no need to replace anything.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Overload current</underline>: possible causes for over-current include short circuits, excessive load, incorrect design, an arc fault, or a ground
   fault. Overload occurs when you exceed the current that your circuit breaker is setup with. Also occur when your load dis-function which lead to high current withdraw
   that will cause overload to your circuit.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Short Circuit</underline>: occurs when a “hot” wire carrying live current comes into contact with a neutral wire, either by touching it directly or
   through arcing—allowing the current to jump from the live wire to the neutral one.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Earth Leakage</underline>: when there is an electrical connection between the ground and a conductor, which has not been designed intentionally.
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 overload is just an excess of current—or amperage—in an electrical circuit. An over-current occurs when the current exceeds the rated amperage capacity of that circuit
 or of the connected equipment (such as an appliance) on that circuit. An over-current can be caused by overloading the circuit or by a short circuit, a ground fault, or
 an arc fault. Circuit breakers and fuses protect circuit wiring from damage caused by over-current.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The best ways to prevent leakage current are to always use shielded cables on motor installations and to make sure that these cables are grounded at both ends. Also,
 check cables and insulation for damage and replace ones that are broken or damaged.

<p class="sub-sub-title">MCB - Miniature Circuit Breaker</p>
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 MCB is used at homes to protect home appliances, and also it is used in industrial automation control panel. MCB can be used as a switch to turn ON/OFF Loads
</p>

<p class="text">
 MCB will be effected by a <underline yellow>short circuit</underline>, <underline yellow>overload</underline> or <underline yellow>imperfect design</underline>. MCB
 Circuit Breaker can take up to <number>100</number> Amps Maximum which protect from an over-current - overheat protection.
</p>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  Let imagine that an excessive current passing thru your cable. Let say you cable size is small can't handle over-current, this cable eventually going to heat up and
  cause a fire. So we use circuit breaker to protect from overheat but it will take seconds or minutes to act or trip
 </p>
</div>

<p class="underline-text inherit"># MCB has three types each on depend on how many cables/phase you are going to connect to it:</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image002.PNG" alt="image" />

<div class="text-box warning">
 <p>
  If we use a three phase cable we better use three-pole Circuit breaker. but if we use single pole CB on each cable and any of them trip then your device is going to be
  connected to two phases MCB this will cause problems on some equipment's
 </p>
