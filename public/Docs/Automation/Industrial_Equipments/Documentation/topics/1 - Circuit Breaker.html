<p class="text">
 A circuit breaker is an automatically or manually operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current from an
 overload or short circuit.
</p>

<p class="text">
 A circuit breaker is an electrical device that provides protection against fault current. It breaks the circuit in case of overloading & short circuit. The fault
 currents generated due to these fault conditions can damage the electrical devices as well as cause fire in a building that can also pose danger to human life.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>You will find a circuit breaker in every automation control panel.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">The circuit breaker is a switching device which also offers protection by tripping and cutting off the supply to load in case of fault.</p>

<p class="text">
 Its like fuse but in circuit breaker it will only trip so we can turn on again no need to replace anything. The circuit breaker instantly cut off the power supply to
 reduce further damage.
</p>

<p class="title-text green">- These conditions are defined as <red>FAULTS</red> :-</p>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Overload current</underline>: possible causes for over-current include short circuits, excessive load, incorrect design, an arc fault, or a ground
   fault. Overload occurs when you exceed the current that your circuit breaker is setup with. Also occur when your load dis-function which lead to high current withdraw
   that will cause overload to your circuit.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Short Circuit</underline>: occurs when a “hot” wire carrying live current comes into contact with a neutral wire, either by touching it directly or
   through arcing—allowing the current to jump from the live wire to the neutral one.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Earth Leakage</underline>: when there is an electrical connection between the ground and a conductor, which has not been designed intentionally.
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 overload is just an excess of current—or amperage—in an electrical circuit. An over-current occurs when the current exceeds the rated amperage capacity of that circuit
 or of the connected equipment (such as an appliance) on that circuit. An over-current can be caused by overloading the circuit or by a short circuit, a ground fault, or
 an arc fault. Circuit breakers and fuses protect circuit wiring from damage caused by over-current.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The best ways to prevent leakage current are to always use shielded cables on motor installations and to make sure that these cables are grounded at both ends. Also,
 check cables and insulation for damage and replace ones that are broken or damaged.
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">A circuit breaker has two types of tripping unit, it has thermal and magnetic tripping unit.</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Thermal Tripping Unit</underline>: is used for protection against overloading. It uses a bi-metallic contact that bends with a change in temperature.
 The current flowing through the bimetallic strip heats up contact & trip the circuit breaker.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image007.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The rate of bending of the bi-metallic strip depends on the amount of current. Therefore, greater the overloading current, faster the circuit breaker trips.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Magnetic Tripping Unit</underline>: is used for protection against short circuit current. It includes a solenoid that produced a strong magnetic field
 due to high short circuit current to instantly trip the circuit breaker.

 MCB will be effected by a <underline yellow>short circuit</underline>, <underline yellow>overload</underline> or <underline yellow>imperfect design</underline>. MCB
 Circuit Breaker can take up to <number>100</number> Amps Maximum which protect from an over-current - overheat protection.
</p>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  Let imagine that an excessive current passing thru your cable. Let say you cable size is small can't handle over-current, this cable eventually going to heat up and
  cause a fire. So we use circuit breaker to protect from overheat but it will take seconds or minutes to act or trip
 </p>
</div>

<p class="underline-text inherit"># MCB has three types each on depend on how many cables/phase you are going to connect to it:</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image002.PNG" alt="image" />

<div class="text-box warning">
 <p>
  If we use a three phase cable we better use three-pole Circuit breaker. but if we use single pole CB on each cable and any of them trip then your device is going to be
  connected to two phases MCB this will cause problems on some equipment's

 You can find it on panel that is distribute power to your automation panels and it protect the whole factory. It monitors the three phases and monitor the current that
 is going back thru the neutral
</p>

<p class="text">
 The ELCB senses any earth leakage like any one touching the phase line by mistake then a leakage current is going to pass thru that phase line to the ground causing the
 ELCB to detect a leakage so it will trip cutting power so fast within millisecond to prevent serious hazards
</p>

<p class="text">
 The ELCB is used to protect the circuit from the electrical leakage. When someone gets an electric shock, then this circuit breaker cuts off the power at the time of
 <number>0.1</number>
 secs for protecting the personal safety and avoiding the gear from the circuit against short circuit and overload.

<p class="sub-title">3. Circuit breaker Trip Curve</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 Trip Curve is about circuit protection from potential hazards that may occurs in your electrical panel at any time. Here some problems that will cause circuit breaker to
 trip.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <ul>
  <li><underline yellow>Short circuit</underline>: Device may malfunction (fail) causing a short circuit (device burn because of a hot wire cause by over-current)</li>
  <li><underline yellow>Over-current</underline>: Main power source may have problem it will Send a high voltage (high current) to your equipment</li>
  <li><underline yellow>Overload</underline>: problem occur on loads like motor may get stack and withdraw more current than it needs then it'll end up burned</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">Trip curve data-sheet graph is available on every circuit breaker, it explains how long a circuit breaker will take at a certain current to Trip</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>Trip curve graph has two variable Time duration and Rated Current X n (6 or 10 times)</p>
</div>

<div class="text-box warning">
 <p>Don't think it will trip when it reaches <number>10</number> Amps. No, it will take time to trip</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 It will take time because most of Circuit Breaker are thermal protection devices which mean it will take time to trip because of current overload. When it reaches a
 certain amount of current it will take a certain amount of time until it trips, so its not an immediate reaction.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Circuit Breaker with thermal protection, the rated current usually is multiply by <number>X1</number> times only. So if your circuit breaker has <number>10</number> Amps
 rated current. here an example
</p>

<p class="text">
 some circuit breaker has a magnetic protection which trip instantly, when a short circuit occurs this type of circuit breaker protection will trip immediately. This
 current usually is in between <number>X6</number> and <number>X10</number> times larger than the rated current of that circuit breaker.
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">- Example 1 :-</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  Circuit breaker of <number>10</number> amps rated current. It reaches <number>10</number> amps which mean in trip curve Rated Current multiply by
  <number>X10</number> or <number>X6</number> time, how long it will take, check the following graph. (our circuit breaker has a magnetic protection)
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">CB reaches between 60-100Amps how fast will the circuit breaker trip ?</p>

<div class="list-content normal arrow">
 <ul>
  <li>60A / 10A = X6 trip Rated Current</li>
  <li>100A / 10A = X10 trip Rated Current</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<img id="image" path="/img/image004.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">As you see it will take an immediate between <number>0.7 - 0.9</number> seconds to trip</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">- Example 2 :-</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  We have a circuit breaker has a <number>20A</number> rating, the tripping curve extracted from its data-sheet is given at 80A, how fast will the circuit breaker trip ?
 </p>
</div>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li>From the trip curve we know that <number>80</number> A is <number>x4</number> the rated current <number>80/20 = 40</number></li>
  <li>So, at <number>4</number> multiple of the current, the corresponding time is <number>1.7</number> seconds</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<img id="image" path="/img/image006.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Trip curve graph has a two sections for thermal response and short circuit (magnetic) response which mean our circuit breaker has both protection thermal and magnetic
 response
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image005.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Thermal response as you see the slow portion response (more delay), and Short circuit or magnetic response it has a fast portion response (less delay) almost an
 immediate tripping
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text yellow">The big question why we need a delay in a thermal protection here why?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 In-Rush Current last for few second or few hundred milliseconds in order to give an over-current to our loads (motor) the circuit breaker will give a chance to the load,
 to withdraw its In-Rush Current to start successfully.
</p>

<p class="text">Again the circuit breaker will give a few seconds chance for inrush current to pass without cutting the power</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline red>Problem Scenario 1</underline>, If the inrush Current lasted longer more than it should be, because there is a problem in our motor, then the circuit
 breaker will trip therefor cutting the power because the wire heated (over-current) before we damage our motor
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline red>Problem Scenario 2</underline>, If a short circuit happened in our motor then huge amount 10X of current is going to pass thru the natural causing heat up
 the circuit breaker with its magnetic property will trip immediately
