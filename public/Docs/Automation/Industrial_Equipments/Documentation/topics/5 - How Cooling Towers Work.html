<p class="main-title">How Cooling Towers Work</p>
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 We are going to learn about the open/wet cooling towers because they are the most common used. Open cooling tower is the most efficient way to reject heat from the
 cooling system but in some cooling system designs and locations.

<p class="text">
 Our cooling tower evaporates water to carry the heat away, its useful but it results in a loss of water from the cooling system thats why is not suitable for all
 locations and system designs.

<p class="title-text green">How do they work ?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 Our cooling tower most of the time is placed on top of a typical office type building, heated water comes from chiller and we use a centrifugal pump to pump or pull the
 heater water up.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This heated water called <yellow>"condenser water"</yellow>, the chiller adds heat to the condenser water and the cooling tower cools it down by rejecting the heat
 outside into the atmosphere.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The heat here is all the unwanted heat from the building caused by the people, computers, sunlight, lighting etc. And also the heat is generated by the compressor of
  the chiller.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="underline-text red"># as you see below our centrifugal pump is between the chiller in the basement and the cooling tower on the roof</p>

<p class="text">
 As you see above, the condenser water leaves the condenser of the chiller at around <number>32째C (89.6째F)</number> and the centrifugal pump sends this heated water up to
 the cooling tower.
</p>

<p class="text">
 After that the cooling water will reject the heat from the condenser water, the condenser water leaves the cooling tower and re-entering the condenser chiller with a
 lowed temperature around <number>27째C (80.6째F)</number>.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>The condenser water that leaves the cooling tower must be less than chiller condenser, so our condenser can pick-up enough heat on it's next cycle.</p>
