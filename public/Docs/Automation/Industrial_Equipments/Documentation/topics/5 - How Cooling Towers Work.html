<p class="text">
 We are going to learn about the open/wet cooling towers because they are the most common used. Open cooling tower is the most efficient way to reject heat from the
 cooling system but in some cooling system designs and locations.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Our cooling tower evaporates water to carry the heat away, its useful but it results in a loss of water from the cooling system thats why is not suitable for all
 locations and system designs.
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">How do they work ?</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 Our cooling tower most of the time is placed on top of a typical office type building, heated water comes from chiller and we use a centrifugal pump to pump or pull the
 heater water up.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This heated water called <yellow>"condenser water"</yellow>, the chiller adds heat to the condenser water and the cooling tower cools it down by rejecting the heat
 outside into the atmosphere.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The heat here is all the unwanted heat from the building caused by the people, computers, sunlight, lighting etc. And also the heat is generated by the compressor of
  the chiller.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="underline-text red"># as you see below our centrifugal pump is between the chiller in the basement and the cooling tower on the roof</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image055.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 As you see above, the condenser water leaves the condenser of the chiller at around <number>32°C (89.6°F)</number> and the centrifugal pump sends this heated water up to
 the cooling tower.
</p>

<p class="text">
 After that the cooling water will reject the heat from the condenser water, the condenser water leaves the cooling tower and re-entering the condenser chiller with a
 lowed temperature around <number>27°C (80.6°F)</number>.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>The condenser water that leaves the cooling tower must be less than chiller condenser, so our condenser can pick-up enough heat on it's next cycle.</p>

<!-- ######################################################### -->

<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">We are going to look at the parts inside the cooling tower, and how these parts work together inside the cooling tower to reject heat efficiently.</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image056.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>1. Condenser water Inlet</underline>: here where the warm condenser water enters the cooling tower, we use pump to pull water from condenser into the
 cooling tower thru this Inlet.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>2. Spray Nozzles</underline>: The warm condenser water is pushed through these nozzles, causing it to spilt into a spray of small droplets (as you see
 below). Water that come from here will be collected in basin.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image057.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>3. Basin</underline>: Here where our water is collected which comes from the spray nozzles, the majority of heat removed is due to evaporation and the
 remaining cooled water drops into a collection which is called basin.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image058.png" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>4. Condenser Water Outlet</underline>: This is where the condenser water will leave the cooling tower. It will leave at a lower temperature than when
 it entered at the top.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>5. Makeup Water</underline>: It is used to determine water level (it can be level sensor), a minimum water level is held in the basin of the cooling
 tower.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Float Vale is a simple mechanical liquid level controller, after detecting the changes of elevation in the liquid-free surface opens or closes a valve accordingly.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image064.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The water basin is filled when water is needed to replace water lost in a cooling cycle after its evaporation, or when the cooling tower drains to get rid of accumulated
 dirt and salt inside the water.
</p>

<p class="text"><underline yellow>6. Overflow</underline>: If the water level in the basin gets too high, it will flow through here and out to a drain.</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>7. Drain</underline>: Here where the water is drained from the cooling tower. This drain water on purpose (on maintenance) when the level of
 <tooltip
  title="impurities (الشوائب)"
  desc="Here where the quality of water become impure. something that is impure or makes something else impure. removing impurities from water"
  >impurities</tooltip
 >
 in the water gets too high.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The impurities are from the accumulation of dirt and salts which build up as water evaporates and leaves these behind. This is often reffed to to <red>"blowdown"</red>.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>8. Filter</underline>: Here where the fan pulls it's air in from outside in both sides as you see below. The filter limits the amount of dirt and leafs
 entering the cooling tower.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image059.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">Cooler and dryer air enters in the cooler tower from both side into the filter and the same air leaves hotter at the top.</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>9. Fill Packaging</underline>: Here the condenser water spray droplets run down thru fill packaging. The water heat is transferred into the fill
 packaging surface area and allowing the air (which flows in the opposite direction) to carry some of the heat away as well as moisture from the evaporation.

<p class="text">
 As you know our top fan pulls air from bottom to top, the air that comes from the bottom will be cooler, this will allow the cold air steam to come thru the Fill
 Packaging to carry some of the heat away as well as <tooltip image="/img/image060.png" title="moisture (الرطوبة)" desc="">moisture</tooltip> from the evaporation.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>10. Drift Eliminator</underline>: here we prevent droplets or sprayed water from escaping the cooling tower, the drift Eliminator causes the air to
 change direction which allow the droplets to condense on the surface to produces moisture that will recover water.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image065.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">Our drift eliminator will condense some of the moisture in the leaving air which reduce operating costs like saving water.</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>11. Fan</underline>: The fan will pull heated air outside the cooling tower. Fan pulls cool ambient air from the bottom through the filters at the base
 and pushes it out the top of the cooling tower, taking heat and moisture with it.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Our warm condensed water comes or pumped from the condenser chiller to the top of the cooling tower. It passes into nozzles which spray the water in small droplets all a
 round the fill packaging.
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">Here a Cooling Tower spray nozzles that sprays a small droplets a cross the fill packaging</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<img id="image" path="/img/image069.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Our spray nozzles increases the waters surface area which allows it to reject more heat. Our droplets water is sprayed
 <small>(which is a water that comes from the condensed chiller)</small> a cross the fill packaging and it runs down the filling packaging.
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">Cooling Tower fill packaging</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<img id="image" path="/img/image070.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 our warmed water runs thru the filling packaging, the water becomes a thin film of water on the filling packaging surface. The water will evaporate into the air and
 carry heat away with it.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image071.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Our cooling tower uses a fan for greater cooling and also to create more evaporation. As we know fan pulls air from bottom to top first thru the filter at the bottom and
 move it up and out through the top of the cooling tower.
</p>

<p class="text">The pulled air also passes through the fill packaging and drift eliminators, also air flows in the opposite direction to the flow of condenser water.</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image072.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The cold air stream will flow thru the filling packaging combining with spray of water and thin film of water, the air stream will carry heat and moisture from the thin
 film of water.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image073.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The warm condenser water enters the tower and is sprayed over the fill packaging. This spray runs down the fill packaging creating a thin film of water over it, the
 water will evaporate and cool down.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Cool dry air enters through the bottom of the tower and passes through the fill packaging in the opposite direction to the flow of condenser water, this will pickup heat
 and moisture from the thin film of water.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The condenser water will be at lower temperature, and it will leave at the bottom of the cooling tower back to the chiller. The hot air will leave the top of the cooling
 tower with that heat but it will also carry some of the water away with it (here where Drift Eliminator do its job).
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">Here a clip show how cooling tower carries heat outside and cooled water goes down into basin</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<img id="image" path="/img/image063.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Water costs money. So in order to keep operating costs and water consumption down, cooling towers often use drift eliminators. These are located above the fill packaging
 and spray nozzles but below the fan.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image074.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The drift eliminators purposely change direction to cause the leaving air to condense against the sides. This squeezes some of the moisture out of the air which then
 runs back down to the fill packaging for further cooling and eventually accumulates in the basin of the cooling tower to be sent back to the chiller.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image065.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The cooler condenser water accumulates in the basin of the tower. This returns to the chiller where it will pickup more heat and the cycle starts over again.
</p>

<p class="text">A filter is usually present over the outlet to ensure no foreign objects enter the pipe as this will enter the blades of the pump.</p>

<p class="text">
 Also we have a float valve in the basin operates the flow of water from the makeup water inlet and ensures a minimum level of water is maintained. This water is topped
 up because of evaporation losses and also during blow downs.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image075.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The overflow prevents too much condenser water entering the cooling tower basin. Water entering here will usually be sent to drain. The drain usually has an automated
 valve attached.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Sensors located in the basin or the condenser system pipework will detect the level of impurities (dirt and salts) and will start to drain the water if the level is too
 high.
</p>

<p class="text">This draining is known as the <red>"blowdown"</red> and causes the float valve to drop which allows fresh water to enter through the makeup inlet.</p>

<p class="text">
 The impurities are already in the condenser water as well as the air, but as the water evaporates it leaves these behind. If enough water evaporates it will cause a
 build up of impurities which can damage the equipment as well as reduce the cooling tower, chiller and pump effectiveness and efficiency.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  In cooler climates, some cooling tower basins will have an electric pan heater installed. This turns on at a specified minimum air temperature (e.g. 5°C, 41°F) to
  prevent frost.
