<p class="main-title">Constant Air Volume System - CAV System</p>
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 CAV is a means of providing HVAC for buildings and it deliverers conditioned air in a constant rate volume. CAV is becoming less common in new buildings simply because
 VAV Systems are replacing them.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>You might find CAV system in small old buildings and they becoming less common in new buildings. Hospitals will often still use these systems for their theatres.</p>
</div>

<p class="underline-text yellow"># why we are replacing CAV with VAV ?</p>

<p class="text">
 VAV systems are replacing them due to their superior zone control and much reduced energy consumption. CAV they are fairly cheap to install and much simpler to install
 and operate but they are not efficient and they consume more energy.
</p>

<p class="text">As you see above, we have the Air handling unit (AHU), which we know its located in the planet room. Two ducts coming ouf the AHU unit:</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li>
   One if the supply duct, which is taking all the fresh treated (outside or circulated) air from the AHU and delivering this throughout the building, and the supplied
   air exits the duct into the rooms via <tooltip image="/img/image126.png" desc="">diffusers</tooltip> .
  </li>
  <li>
   Other duct the return duct, after our air circulates a round the room and the used dirty air is then sucked into the return duct via
   <tooltip image="/img/image125.jpg" desc="">grille</tooltip> somewhere else in the room.
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Now our warm dirty air will return back to the AHU where it can either be dispersed straight out to atmosphere or some of it can be recycled and reused.
</p>

<p class="title-text green">CAV Systems</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">CAV system do have some limitation because the supply air temperature is varied, but the volume flow rate (supply) of air is constant.</p>

<p class="text">
 The air that CAV system provide is about 13C/55F degree, the air is in consistent flow and the air volume is constant only the temperature of that air changes.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The temperature can be adjusted to suit the needs of the building. When we say the air is constant so we need provide diffusers depend on the room size area. And also
 the activity’s occurring within the rooms will dictate how much air needs to be delivered to a room.
</p>

<p class="text">
 If we check our illustrator again, we see the small room in the middle might require something like 3 cubic meters per second. However, the larger rooms on either side
 might require somewhere around 20 or 30 cubic meters per second.
</p>

<p class="text">
 It could be that the entire building only requires 30 cubic meters per second as well. ay we have a 40 story building with just one enormous AHU on the roof, then that’s
 going need to supply an extremely large volume of air per second.
</p>

<p class="text">
 We have a problem with CAV system, is that everything connected to this AHU is classed as one zone, and that means all the rooms connected to it receive the same
 temperature air regardless of their heat load.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  If one room was a busy meeting room in the middle of summer which is full of people, it’s going to be generating a lot of heat. It also has solar thermal gain too. But
  with a CAV system, that room will receive the same air temperature as the empty room next to it. This means the zones are given a set amount of cooling regardless of
  their requirements. This is not efficient because it’s going to be wasting a lot of cooling energy, generating and providing cooling for no reason.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 In CAV system, the fans would be running <number>100%</number> the entire time the system is running. Although you could fit some
 <tooltip
  desc="What is a VFD? The most common HVAC definition of a Variable Frequency Drive describes it as an electrical device used as a fan accessory to increase and decrease the rotations per minute (RPM) of an alternating current (AC) motor."
  >VFD</tooltip

  desc="Variable speed drives (VSD) or frequency inverters are solid-state devices and save energy whenever electric motors run at less than full power. VSD is actually a frequency converter in which 50Hz or 60Hz ac input voltage is first rectified into dc which is then converted back into variable-frequency ac voltage."
  >VSD</tooltip

 Variable Speed/Frequency Drives, to reduce the motor speed that pumps the air force.
</p>

<p class="text">
 It is not difficult, but not impossible, to convert a CAV into a VAV system. It's going to take a lot of time and effort. You have to change a lot of things and modify a
 lot of the controls for it. The conversion can unlock a lot of energy savings although a CAV is cheaper to install and easy to operate.
</p>

<p class="title-text green">CAV Single Duct</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 If you look at the schematical representation of the CAV system below, you see that all the rooms are connected to the main duct, and the only way to control temperature
 is in the main AHU. This mean that the rooms will receive the same tempered air at a constant volume.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image127.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Our CAV system only works well if all the rooms are of a similar condition or require a similar cooling/heating condition. But if a room has a different cooling/heating
 load, then it might need to be connected to a different AHU. Depending on the size, it might be better with it’s own AHU supply.
</p>

<p class="text">
 To solve the temperature issue, we can just install terminal re-heaters (electrical heaters), we can place them in a metal box in the ceiling, before the diffuser.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  We can install electrical heaters or hot water system to reheat the air up to higher temperature. Both electrical heaters and hot water system will cost energy. Our AHU
  has its own heater which means you're already cooling the air down. With re-heaters you’re paying again to heat that air back up So, you’re wasting money on the cooling
  and then also on the heating.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 CAV system supplies the coldest air temperature and that suits the room with the largest cooling load. If you look at the illustration again above, you see the largest
 room will likely have the biggest cooling load but the other rooms will have the reheater installed.
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">CAV Dual Duct</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 You can have two ducts running, one supplying cold air and the other supplying warm air. Both ducts extends into a damper box, both air mixed by some dampers in a box at
 each room just to suit the temperature inside.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image128.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 That return air is then also returned back to the AHU, ready to be recycled or dispersed out to atmosphere. This system gives a much improved thermal control but there
 is little control of humidity.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Again, it’s not particularly energy efficient either. As you’re supplying air through two streams, you have a lot of resistance which the fan is going to have to
 overcome. You’re also unnecessarily heating and cooling air which might be mixed.
</p>

<p class="text">
 To make the dual duct system more energy efficient, then you should ensure that a temperature reset is enabled on controls. You will need a few advanced control points
 in there and some temperature measurement sensors.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The temperature reset controls will monitor the air conditions which are required, and then reduce the air temperature of the hot air to bring that temperature down to
 the lowest acceptable temperature.
</p>

<p class="text">The controls will also raise the temperature of the cold air temperature to reduce the cooling load provided by the coil.</p>
