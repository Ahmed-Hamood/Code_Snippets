<p class="main-title">Three Phase Electricity</p>
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 In electricity, the phase refers to the distribution of a load. Before we explain three phase wire first lets know whats single phase power. Single-phase power is a
 two-wire alternating current <number>(AC)</number> power circuit.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In Single-phase power we have two wires, there is one power wire—the <text>phase</text> wire—and one <text>neutral</text> wire. Our current will flow between the power
 wire (through the load) and the neutral wire.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Three-phase power is a three-wire ac power circuit with each phase AC signal 120 electrical degrees apart. It also gives the continuous supply to the load. The
 three-phase system has higher efficiency and minimum losses.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>Residential homes are usually served by a single-phase power supply, while commercial and industrial facilities usually use a three-phase supply.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-box">
 For high power and voltage we use three phase system/power to get an efficient power For example electric Motor is a spinning object in compressor when you use it with:-
 <ul>
  <li><underline yellow>One phase system</underline> = you will get a vibration in the motor</li>
  <li><underline yellow>Three phase system/circuit</underline> = you will get a lot less vibration and more efficient transfer of energy into the motor</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 One key difference between single-phase vs. three-phase is that a three-phase power supply better accommodates higher loads. Single-phase power supplies are most
 commonly used when typical loads are lighting or heating, rather than large electric motors.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Single-phase systems can be derived from three-phase systems. In the US, this is done via a transformer to get the proper voltage, while in the EU it is done directly.
 Voltage levels in the EU are such that a three-phase system can also serve as three single-phase systems.

<p class="text">One other important difference between 3-phase power vs. single phase power is the consistency of the delivery of power.</p>

<p class="text">
 Because of the peaks and dips in voltage, a single-phase power supply simply does not offer the same consistency as a three-phase power supply. A three-phase power
 supply delivers power at a steady, constant rate.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Some three-phase power supplies do use a fourth wire, which is a neutral wire. The two most common configurations of three-phase systems are known as wye and delta. A
 delta configuration has only three wires, while a wye configuration may have a fourth, neutral, wire.

 We will start with simple AC generator, starting with a single phase to understand whats happening then after we are going to add up phases until we get to three phases.

<p class="text">
 As you see above, we have a rotated motor with rotor magnet around it, a round the rotate magnet we have stator that we will use to hold copper coil in both sides.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image025.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Here we take a copper wire and wrap it into two coils then place these coils opposite each other, within a stator, and connect the ends together to create a complete
 circuit.
</p>

<p class="text">If we start rotating the magnet (using motor) in between these coils, as we know the magnet will generate a magnetic field.</p>
<p class="text">The magnetic field will disturb the free electrons within the copper wire and an electrical current will begin to flow alternatively.</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image026.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 As the magnet rotates so does the polarity of the magnetic field. As you can see in the illustration the north <number>-</number> and south <number>+</number> pole are
 rotating and as they rotate they pass across the coils which will force the electrons to move.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image027.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Notice the lines of the magnetic field are in these oval shapes on each side and they meet through the central axis of the magnet. You can think of one side at being
 positive and the other side being negative and between these ovals the magnetic field is neutral.
</p>

<p class="text">
 You can see that the intensity of the magnetic field increases on either side up until the centre where it is at its maximum strength and then it decreases again until
 it gets back to the neutral point.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image026.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 As the magnetic field rotates through the coil, the coil will experience the increasing intensity of the magnetic fields positive half. During this increasing intensity
 the free electrons, within the copper coil, will be pushed and begin to move faster and faster in one direction up until it reaches the maximum point of the magnetic
 field.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Then as the magnetic field decreases the flow of electrons will begin to slow all the way until it reaches the neutral point where no electrons will flow.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Then comes the negative side of the magnetic field, as this passes through its going to pull the free electrons backwards. Again the flow of electrons will flow faster
 and faster up until the maximum point of the magnetic field and then it will decrease back to the neutral point.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This is why AC electricity is called alternating current because the current of electrons alternates in direction backwards and forwards just like the tide of the sea.
</p>

<p class="text">
 If we check above, the speed of the electrons flowing during the rotation, then we get a sine wave pattern. In this sine wave you can see the electrons are stationary at
 start, in the neutral zone, and then the speed increases through the positive half to the maximum. It then decreases all the way to neutral where no electrons flow again
 and then comes the negative half where the electrons speed up to the maximum point, and then slow down until the magnet has completed 1 full rotation where this will
 repeat.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This complete rotation is known as a cycle and the number of cycles per second is called frequency which is measured in hertz. You've probably seen
 <number>50Hz</number> or <number>60Hz</number> written on your electrical goods, this means the generator of the power station is completing a full rotation either 50 or
 <number>60</number> times per second.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The direction of the current is changing <number>50</number> or <number>60</number> times per second. When it's written on electrical products this is just tell the user
 what type of electricity it should be connected to.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Now coming back to the sine wave we saw earlier. This plot of current also represents power, and if we connect a lamp into the circuit we see it will increase in
 brightness all the way to the peak then it decreases in brightness down until the neutral point where the lamp is off as no current is flowing, but then it increases in
 brightness again as the electrons start to flow back through it in the opposite direction until again it reaches the neutral point.
</p>

<p class="text">
 At the neutral point in the cycle the lamp is not producing any light, at the increasing and decreasing points in the cycle the lamp is dim. The lamp is only fully on
 and bright at the maximum points in the cycles. This means the light is flickering constantly on and off.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image031.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 To improve this we can add in another set of coils, or a second phase, into the generator and place these 120 degrees rotation from the first set of coils, and then
 connect this up to another lamp.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This rotation means the coils experience the changing intensity of the magnetic field at different points in time. The first coil reaches its maximum current and
 brightness and as it decreases the second coil will begin to increase.
</p>

<p class="text">
 This has improved the lighting but there’s still a gap which will cause a flicker so we can add in a third set of coils or a third phase and this will mean that one of
 the lamps are almost always at its maximum brightness so the lighting is nearly constant. This is the basics of three phase electricity. This means more power is
 delivered and a more consistent speed is achieved.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image032.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 There are still some small gaps between the phases and you could keep adding in more and more phases to fill in these gaps but this becomes more and more expensive to
 keep running all these cables, so three phase electricity became widely accepted as it is a good compromise between power provided and cost to build.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In the real world you’re not going to use three lamps on different phases to create lighting. The lamps in your homes are all on single phase but they are flickering its
 just that they are turning on and off so fast that the human eye can’t see it unless you record the lamp in slow motion.
