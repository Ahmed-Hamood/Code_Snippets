<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Current</underline> is the flow of electrons. When a circuit is closed then a current of electrons can flow and when a circuit is open then no current
 can flow.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Electric current refers to the flow of electricity in an electronic circuit, and to the amount of electricity flowing through a circuit. It is measured in amperes (A).
 The larger the value in amperes, the more electricity is flowing in the circuit.
</p>

<p class="text">
 We can measure the flow of electrons just like you can measure the flow of water through a pipe. To measure the flow of electrons we use the unit of
 <text>Amperes</text> or <text>Amps</text> for short.

<div class="text-box">
 <p><number>1</number> Amp means <number>1</number> Coulomb per second and one coulomb equals <number>6,242,000,000,000,000,000</number> electrons per second. <br /></p>
</div>

<p class="text">This is an extremely large number which is why they are grouped together and called Amps.</p>

<p class="text">
 Current is the rate at which electrons flow past a point in a complete electrical circuit. We use Amps to measure current, it expresses the quantity of electrons or
 electrical charge flowing past a point in a circuit over given time

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Voltage</underline> is a pushing force of electrons in a circuit, think of voltage like pressure in a water pipe. The more pressure you have the more
 water can flow. The more voltage you have the more electrons can flow.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image014.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">A Volt is Joule per Coulomb A Joule is a measurement of energy or work. A Coulomb is a group of flowing electrons. Heres the formula.</p>

<p class="text">
 A <number>9V</number> battery can provide <number>9</number> Joules of energy, in the form of work or heat, per group of electrons that flow from one terminal of the
 battery to the other.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In this case the electrons from one terminal of the battery, through the L.E.D bulb and then into the other terminal of the battery. Therefore <number>9</number> Joules
 of light and heat is produced by the bulb.

<p class="text">
 The potential energy of the electrons charges or the amount of pressure on these charges thru wire. Higher voltage mean higher amount of current (electron charges) will
 travel thru the wire.

<p class="text">
 Resistance is a <tooltip desc="is limiting or reducing amount of electrons flowing thru a wire">restriction</tooltip> to the flow of electrons in a circuit. Every wire
 that curries current will naturally have some resistance. <mark>Each wire material has different resistance to the flow of electrons</mark>.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>Resistance is measured in ohms Ω - Resistance consist of materials, that pushed the electrons back against the current flow</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Resistance is used to decrease the electrons charges or Lower/Drop the voltage or decrease the potential energy of the electron charge. Mean lower potential energy and
 less current (electron charges), after hitting the resistance the energy of the electron charge has been decreased that means the voltage is decreased;
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image017.PNG" alt="image" />

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <ul>
  <li>The longer the wire the greater the resistance. (less current flow).</li>
  <li>The thicker the wire the less the resistance. (more current flow).</li>
  <li>Copper wire has less resistance than the aluminum wire</li>
  <li>Temperature will effect the level of resistance.</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Resistance occurs when electrons collide with atoms. The number of collisions varies by material, some materials such as Iron will have a very high rate of collisions
 whereas other materials such as copper has much fewer collisions.
</p>

<p class="text">
 When collisions occur the atoms generate heat and at a certain temperature the material will then start to produce light as well as heat, which is how the incandescent
 lamps work.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  We need resistance in our circuit to limit current flow and to reduce collision, so our light doesn't burn out. Our light only can handle a certain temperature or
  collision level, too much current mean too much collision therefor too much heat.
 </p>

<p class="title-text yellow">- Resistor</p>

<p class="text">
 Resistors add resistance to the circuit and reduces the flow of electrical current/electrons. The purpose of using resistor is to protect other electrical components
 from receiving too much current.

  Always keep in mind that electricity always follows the path of least resistance to ground.

   title="create path"
   desc="What this means is that if you give positive voltage the choice to pass through a motor to ground, or follow a wire straight to ground, it will follow the wire because the wire provides the least resistance. This also means that by using the wire to bypass the source of resistance straight to ground, you have created a short circuit. Always make sure that you never accidentally connect positive voltage to ground while wiring things in parallel or series."

  You should keep in mind is that electricity in a circuit must be used. In other word you should provide something wired between positive (+) and ground (-) that adds
  resistance to the flow of electricity and uses it up.

<p class="text">There needs to be something wired between positive and ground that adds resistance to the flow of electricity and uses it up.</p>
