 Everything is made from <tooltip desc="Everything in our universe, including you, is made up of atoms.">atoms</tooltip>, Different materials have different types of
 atoms. At the centre of an Atom is the <underline>Nucleus</underline> which consist of two particles known as the <underline yellow>Neutron</underline> and
 <underline red>Proton</underline>.
</p>

<p class="text">
 At the very centre of an atom is a group, known as the nucleus, which is made up of protons and/or neutrons. The number of protons and neutrons in each nucleus is what
 makes materials, or elements, different.

 The <underline yellow>Neutron</underline> has no

  >electrical charge</tooltip

 but the <underline red>Proton</underline> has a positive electrical charge. Surrounding the <underline>Nucleus</underline> are different layers of orbital shells which
 act like flight paths for another type of particle known as the <underline green>electron</underline>.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The <underline red>protons</underline> are positively charged, the <underline>neutrons</underline> have no charge and the <green>electrons</green> are negatively
  charged. The electrons have the same quantity of charge as the <underline red>proton</underline>, except in the opposite polarity.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 As you see in <underline>image Atom 1</underline> above, the <green>electrons</green> travel long these paths much like satellites orbit around our planet, except that
 the electrons travel at almost the speed of light.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The negative charge of the <underline yellow>Neutrons</underline> is attracted to the positive charge of the <underline red>Protons</underline> which keeps the
 <green>electrons</green>
 in orbit. Each orbital shell can hold a set number of electrons.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The number of <underline red>Protons</underline>, <underline yellow>Neutrons</underline> and <green>Electrons</green> an Atom has tells us which material it is and the
 combination is unique for each material.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  Each shell can hold a maximum number of electrons, the first shell has a maximum of <number>2</number> electrons, the second shell can hold up to <number>8</number> and
  the <number>3</number> can hold up to <number>32</number>
  etc.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Atoms hold onto their electrons tightly but some materials will hold onto their electrons more tightly than others. The outer most orbital shell is known as the
 <underline>Valance shell</underline> and in this shell some materials will have loosely bound electrons which can float to other Atoms.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The outermost shell is known as the <underline>Valance shell</underline>, this orbit is the easiest for electrons to be knocked out of or join. The shell closest to the
  nucleus is the most difficult for electrons to move to or from.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Loosely bound</underline> - free electrons material we called them conductors (موصلات) which can pass electrons to other atoms. Most metals are
 conductors like
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li>Copper</li>
  <li>Silver</li>
  <li>Gold</li>
  <li>Aluminum</li>
  <li>Steel</li>
  <li>Sea water</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Tight bound </underline> - non-free electrons which can't pass electrons to other atoms we called them insulators (عوازل) Insulators like
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <ul>
  <li>Silicone rubber</li>
  <li>Glass</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Diamond</li>
  <li>dry wood</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 It is easier for some materials than others for electrons to be knocked out of or join the <underline>Valance shell</underline>. Materials such as copper and aluminium
 can easily do this but wood and ceramics find it very difficult. Those that find it easy are called conductors and those that find it difficult are called insulators.

<p class="text">
 The charge of the particles and their behavior to each other is a very important part of generating electricity. Opposite charges attract each other and alike charges
 will repel each other, you may have seen this when moving two magnets near one another.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image011.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 When two <green>electrons</green> approach each other, they will try to force each other away because they have alike charges, however they will be attracted by a
 <red>protons</red> positive charge.
</p>

<p class="text">This attraction and repulsion helps the atom stay together but we can also manipulate this to enable us to generate electricity.</p>

<p class="text">
 The atoms in a copper wire can easily lose or gain electrons from it's <underline>Valance shell</underline>. We can eject an electron from the
 <underline>Valance shell</underline> by forcing it out with another electron or pull it out by attracting it with a proton.
</p>

<p class="text">
 When an electron leaves the valence shell it is known as a <text>free electron</text> which can move around in any direction within the space between atoms.
</p>

<p class="text">
 If we connect the copper wire to a battery and make a circuit, then we can force <green>electrons</green> to be ejected from the
 <underline>Valance shell</underline> where they will flow in the same direction, and thus we have electricity.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image012.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The electrons will be forced to move because a battery has an excess of electrons on the negative terminal and an absence of electrons on the positive terminal. Once a
 circuit is made, the negative terminal will try to force electrons through the atoms of the copper wire so that they can reach the positive terminal.

<!-- ######################################################### -->

<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 Materials which can pass electrons are known as <text>Conductors</text> meaning they can conduct electricity. Most Metals are conductors. Atoms which do not have free
 electrons are known as insulators, materials like glass and rubber are good examples of this.
</p>

<p class="text">
 We can combine Conductors and Insulators together to safely use electricity. This is is done by surrounding the conductor with an insulator. This allows electrons to
 flow but it restricts where they can flow to. This is how a cables and wires work.

<p class="text">
 If you see closely below, our electrons within the copper atoms move freely without any current applied, these electrons will move freely and randomly between other
 atoms.
</p>

<p class="underline-text red"># free electrons with no current applied :-</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image007.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 If we look inside a slice of Copper cable above, we would see the free electrons of the atoms move from one atom to another, however this occurs randomly in any
 direction.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Now, if we connect our copper wire in a closed circuit to a source power such as a <orange>battery</orange>, the battery will generate a force, this force is called
 <text yellow>voltage</text>.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image008.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 The voltage will force the free electrons to move and this will cause them to all flow in the same direction, to try and get back to the other terminal of the battery
 which is battery from the negative <number>(-)</number> to the positive <number>(+)</number>.

<p class="text">The term circuit refers to a route which the electrons can flow along to get between the two terminals of the power source (Positive and Negative).</p>

<p class="underline-text red"># open and closed electrical circuit :-</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image009.gif" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 When a circuit is closed then electrons can flow from one terminal to the other. When a circuit is open then there is a gap in the circuit so electrons can't flow.
</p>

<p class="text">
 As you see above, we placed an electrical components in the path of the free electrons which flow in a circuit. This will force the electrons to flow through the
 component and this can be used to perform work such as generate light.
