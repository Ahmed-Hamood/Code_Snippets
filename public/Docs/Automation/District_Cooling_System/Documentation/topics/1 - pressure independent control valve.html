<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">The pressure independent control valve is a device composed of an automatic flow rate regulator and a control valve with actuator.</p>

<p class="text">PICV is a type of valve found in Hydronic systems, meaning water based, which provide heating and cooling in buildings.</p>

 The pressure independent control valve device can adjust flow rate and keep it constant in the presence of changing differential pressure conditions of the circuit in
 which it is installed.

 <p class="list-title">PICV has two main functions:-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Control the amount of liquid flowing through a pipe</li>
  <li>Automatically adjust and compensate for pressure fluctuations in the system to maintain a stable and reliable control.</li>
 </ul>

 These valves are basically a number of different valves conveniently combined into one unit. This saves on design and installation time as well as improving the
 efficiency of the system.
