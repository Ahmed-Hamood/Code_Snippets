 <underline yellow>Resource groups</underline> is a logical container for only resources, it's simply used for grouping related resources. When you create a resource,
 you're required to place it into a resource group.

 <underline yellow>Resource group</underline> is utility that provides a convenient way to group resources together to manage and organize them in a better way. You
 decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.

  <li>A resource can connect to resources in other resource groups. This scenario is common when the two resources are related but don't share the same lifecycle. For example, you can have a web app that connects to a database in a different resource group.</li>
  <li>You can deploy up to <number>800</number> instances of a resource type in each resource group. Some resources have a limit on the number instances per region.</li>

 Its good to have a consistent naming convention for your resource group, when deciding on a naming convention to standardize on, there are several different naming

  <li>another option is <code>&lt;Resource>-&lt;subscriptionType>-&lt;Region></code> like <green>VNET-Shared01-WestUS</green></li>

<div class="list-content custom">
