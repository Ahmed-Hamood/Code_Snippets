<p class="text">
 In your company you have on premises data-center, the company is responsible for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the
 servers if anything happens.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The IT department in your company is responsible for maintaining all the infrastructure and software needed to keep the data-center up and running. They're also likely
 to be responsible for keeping all systems patched and on the correct version.
</p>

<p class="text">
 With <underline yellow>the shared responsibility model</underline>, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer. Using cloud computing,
 you don't need to build a traditional corporate data-center and make large upfront investments in hardware and spend a lot of time provisioning the hardware with exactly
 the right type and size of computing resources you need to power and run your services.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The Cloud provider is responsible for Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity. The consumer isn't
 <tooltip desc="set or place together">collocated</tooltip> with the data-center, so it wouldn't make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsibilities.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud. And also, responsible access security to give access to those who need it. On-premises
 data-center, you're responsible for everything. But with cloud provider those responsibilities shift
</p>

<div class="list-content normal">
 <p class="list-title">- Cloud service types consumer and cloud provider responsibilities :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>IaaS - infrastructure as a service</underline>: places the most responsibilities on the consumer, the cloud provider only responsible for the basics
   of physical security, power, and connectivity.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>PaaS - Platform as a service</underline>: being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS in the middle it evenly distributes responsibility between the
   cloud provider and the consumer.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>SaaS - Software as a service</underline>: most of the responsibility with the cloud provider, and the consumer only responsible for data information
   and account access. It places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider.
  </li>
 </ul>

<p class="text">
 IaaS places the largest share of responsibility with you as consumer. The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the
 internet. Also you're responsible for installation and configuration, patching and updates, and security.

<p class="sub-sub-title">PaaS - Shared responsibility model</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->

<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 PaaS splits the responsibility between you and the cloud provider. The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the
 internet, just like in IaaS.
</p>

<p class="text">
 In the PaaS model, the cloud provider will also maintain the operating systems, databases, and development tools. Think of PaaS like using a domain joined machine: IT
 maintains the device with regular updates, patches, and refreshes.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Depending on the configuration, you or the cloud provider may be responsible for networking settings and connectivity within your cloud environment, network and
 application security, and the directory infrastructure.

<p class="sub-sub-title">SaaS - Shared responsibility model</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 SaaS is the model that places the most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user. You're responsible for the data that you put
 into the system, the devices that you allow to connect to the system, and the users that have access.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Nearly everything else falls to the cloud provider. The cloud provider is responsible for physical security of the data-centers, power, network connectivity, and
 application development and patching.
