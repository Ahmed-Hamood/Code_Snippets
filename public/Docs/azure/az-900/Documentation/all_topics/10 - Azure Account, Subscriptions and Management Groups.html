 To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. After you've created an Azure subscription, you can start creating Azure resources within each
 subscription.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image052.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 For example, your company might use a single Azure account for your business and separate subscriptions for development, marketing, and sales departments. After you've

<p class="text">
 A subscription is an agreement between an organization and Microsoft to use resources, for which charges are either paid on a per-license basis or pay-as-you-go
 resource-consumption basis. Subscriptions are simply used to create and use Azure services.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image046.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 A subscription follows a certain billing model, it could be pay-as-you-go or enterprise agreement. Subscription is agreement on how I'm going to actually pay for the
 services that im gonna use.
</p>

<div class="quote-text green-border">
 <p>
  In order to create your cloud-based resources in azure you will need at least one azure subscription to link it to your azure account. When you create an Azure resource
  like a <text>VM</text>, you identify the subscription it belongs to
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Subscriptions are a unit of <underline>management</underline>, <underline>billing</underline>, and <underline>scale</underline>. Similar to how resource groups are a way
 to logically organize resources, subscriptions allow you to logically organize your resource groups and facilitate billing.
</p>

<p class="text">
 A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access and provision azure products and services/resources. In your subscription you can manage resources
 in resources groups.

<p class="text">
 In Azure account you can create multiple subscriptions separated, so you can use the subscriptions to configure different billing models and apply different
 access-management policies.
</p>

<p class="text">
 You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources.
 <mark>There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use</mark>:
</p>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Billing boundary</underline>: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. You can create multiple subscriptions
   for different types of billing requirements. Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Access control boundary</underline>: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to
   reflect different organizational structures.
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Access control boundary like apply different access control for each subscription, for example within a business you have different departments and you apply control
 access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions. And apply different billing model for each department.

 <p>Each subscription is a separate entity that can't be merged.</p>

<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 Similar to using resource groups to separate resources by function or access, you might want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing management
 purposes.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <p class="list-title">- You might choose to create additional subscriptions to separate :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Environments</underline>: You can choose to create subscriptions to set up separate environments for development and testing, security, or to isolate
   data for compliance reasons. This design is particularly useful because resource access control occurs at the subscription level.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Organizational structures</underline>: You can create subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. For example, you could limit one
   team to lower-cost resources, while allowing the IT department a full range. This design allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision
   within each subscription.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Billing</underline>: You can create additional subscriptions for billing purposes. Because costs are first aggregated at the subscription level, you
   might want to create subscriptions to manage and track costs based on your needs. For instance, you might want to create one subscription for your production workloads
   and another subscription for your development and testing workloads.
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <p class="list-title">- You might also need additional subscriptions because of: :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Subscription limits</underline>: Subscriptions are bound to some hard limitations. For example, the maximum number of Azure ExpressRoute circuits per
   subscription is 10. Those limits should be considered as you create subscriptions on your account. If there's a need to go over those limits in particular scenarios,
   you might need additional subscriptions.

 If you have multiple subscriptions, you can organize them into invoice sections. Each invoice section is a line item on the invoice that shows the charges incurred that
 month. For example, you might need a single invoice for your organization but want to organize charges by department, team, or project.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Depending on your needs, you can set up multiple invoices within the same billing account. To do this, create additional billing profiles. Each billing profile has its
 own monthly invoice and payment method.

 A billing profile represents an invoice and the related billing information such as payment methods and billing address. A monthly invoice is generated at the beginning

 Management Groups is use to group multiple subscription, it provides a level if scope above subscription, for example If you have many subscriptions, you might need a
 way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions.
</p>

<div class="quote-text white-border">
 <p>You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply governance conditions to the management groups.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 imagine if youâ€™re dealing with multiple applications, multiple development teams, in multiple geographies, with Management Groups you can keep things organized. All
 subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group, the same way that resource groups inherit settings from
 subscriptions and resources inherit from resource groups.

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>The security policy that you apply in Management Group can't be altered by the resource or subscription owner, which allows for improved governance.</p>
</div>

<p class="title-text"># All subscriptions inherit creation rule from the management group :-</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image050.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 You can build a flexible structure of management groups and subscriptions to organize your resources into a hierarchy for unified policy and access management.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <ul>
  <li>We can have 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.</li>
  <li>
   Management groups can be nested, you can create a tree that support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.

<p class="underline-text">- Some examples of how you could use management groups might be:</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Create a hierarchy that applies a policy</underline>. You could limit VM locations to the US West Region in a group called Production. This policy will
 inherit onto all the subscriptions that are descendants of that management group and will apply to all VMs under those subscriptions. This security policy can't be
 altered by the resource or subscription owner, which allows for improved governance.

 assignment on the management group, and all underlying subscriptions will inherit it.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Assigning <underline>Azure RBAC</underline> at the management group level means that all sub-management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources underneath
 that management group would also inherit those permissions. One assignment on the management group can enable users to have access to everything they need instead of
 scripting Azure RBAC over different subscriptions.
