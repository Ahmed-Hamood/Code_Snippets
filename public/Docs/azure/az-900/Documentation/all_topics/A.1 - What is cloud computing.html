 Cloud computing is a model for delivering
 <tooltip
  text="<red>computing services</red> also known as as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) with common IT infrastructure and software/app for analytics and intelligence"

 over the internet. Simply it's like using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than local server or personal
 computer.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Cloud computing lets you choose the power and features you need to run your software. All Servers/PCs are in a cloud provider's data-center instead of physically with
 you. Cloud only lets you pay fot only the services you use
</p>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <p class="list-title">- Computing services which include common IT infrastructure resources and software such as: -</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Servers with Virtual Machines and containers</li>
  <li>Storage (HD, SSD)</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
  <li>Networking</li>
  <li>Software/App</li>
  <li>Analytics and intelligence</li>

   Also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like <yellow underline>Internet of Things (IoT)</yellow>, <yellow underline>machine learning (ML)</yellow>,

<p class="text">
 Cloud computing really represents renting resources like <text>CPU</text>, <text>RAM</text> and <text>storage</text> from someone else data-center like cloud provider
 such as Azure. You only pay for what you use <text green>Pay-as-you-go</text> pricing model.

<div class="text-box note">
 The cloud provider takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you. Someone else gets to manage the infrastructure for you like maintenance, backup and
 make sure your OS is up-to-date and also make sure that everything is up and running 24hrs a day.

<p class="text">
 Cloud computing offers flexible resources and
 <tooltip
  text="Through economies of scale, cloud providers save organizations money because they purchase computing resources in massive quantities at lower costs. When companies utilize these shared resources, they avoid the substantial up-front CAPEX costs of purchasing their own expensive infrastructure."
  >economies of scale</tooltip
 >, this means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure resources rapidly, you don't have to wait to build a new data-center.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Cloud is not <tooltip text="means to limit or force something.">constrained</tooltip> by physical infrastructures the same way that traditional data center is. You can
 treat cloud resources like you would your resources in your own data center. When you're done using them, you give them back.

<p class="sub-title">2. Common cloud/computing services</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->

<p class="text">
 A cloud provider offers a hundred of services that are grouped with various types of services. The four most common types of cloud services for IaaS - infrastructure as
 a Service would be Compute, Networking, Storage and Databases.
</p>

<div class="list-content custom">
 <p class="list-title">- Cloud computing common services :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <yellow underline>Compute power</yellow>: is how much processing your computer can do. compute power is a server consist of CPU, RAM and storage. we use virtual
   machines or containers that run different OS like windows, linux/unix or web container, and with them we can create apps for web, AI, machine learning and more.
  </li>
  <li>
   <yellow underline>Storage</yellow>: is a volume of data you can store, with unlimited data storage that you need/request overtime. We store structured or unstructured
   data like files and databases. Cloud delivers a thousand of popular DB technologies. Also azure provides tools that allow you to migrate your data/app to the cloud
  </li>
  <li>
   <yellow underline>Networking</yellow>: After gathering your components, we need to connect them to each other securely which our cloud provide a secure networking
   functionality. You also can connect azure to your company network thru private connection <red>VPN</red> or <red>ExpressRoute</red>.

 Cloud provider offers data backup, disaster recovery, and <a id="link-nav" href="#title-5">Global</a> data replication services, and fault tolerance. Azure cloud
 infrastructure is built in order to accommodate disasters; If one component fails, a backup component will seamlessly take ownership, assuring services availability.
