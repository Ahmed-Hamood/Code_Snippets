<p class="main-title">A.2 - Cloud models public, private, and hybrid clouds</p>

<p class="text">
 Cloud model or cloud deployment model is a concept that describes where are the company resources are deployed, it can be either deployed into public (cloud provider) or
 private (on-premises) data-center environment.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate your app/data to the cloud. You need to decide when to use one of the models, choose
 infrastructure depending on your budget, and on your security, scalability, and maintenance needs.
</p>

<p class="text">
 There are three main ways to deploy cloud model services: on a <text>public cloud</text>, <text>private cloud</text>, or <text>hybrid cloud</text>. Each deployment
 method depends on your business needs.

<p class="sub-title">1. Public cloud - Cloud native</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->

<p class="text">
 <yellow underline>Public clouds</yellow> are the most common type of cloud computing deployment. It's built, controlled and maintained by a third-party cloud service
 provider like <sky>Microsoft Azure</sky>. With a public cloud, resources/services are available over the internet, so anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can
 access and use resources/services.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Cloud provider has resources such as servers, storages and other supported infrastructure/hardware, everyone share the same resources with other organization (cloud
 tenants), Sharing computing resources will save additional costs for you.
</p>

<div class="quote-text green-border">
 <p>
  With public cloud no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date, everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware. You only access services and manage your account
  using a web browser.

 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline>High scalability/agility</underline>: you don't have to buy a new server in order to scale, near-unlimited scalability on-demand resources are available to
   meet your business needs. Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
  </li>

  <li>
   <underline>Pay-as-you-go pricing</underline>: you pay only for what you use, no CapEx - capital expenditures to scale up. Lower costs, no need to purchase hardware or
   software, and you pay only for the service you use.
  </li>

  <li>
   <underline>No maintenance required</underline>: You're not responsible for maintenance or updates of the hardware, the cloud provider provides the maintenance. On your
   side no deep technical skills required, minimal technical knowledge to set up and use. You can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure
   workloads are secure, safe, and highly available

<p class="sub-title">2. Private cloud - On-Premise or Traditional on-premises</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->

<p class="text">
 <yellow underline>Private cloud</yellow> is your own cloud environment data-center (on-premises), it consist of computing resources used exclusively by one business or
 organization. It's a cloud that delivers IT services over the internet that's used by a single entity.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <yellow underline>Private cloud</yellow> provide self-service access to compute resources to users/employees in your organization. Users can be external customer or
 specific internal departments such as Accounting or Human Resources.
</p>

<div class="quote-text red-border">
 <p>
  Private clouds are often used by <underline>government agencies</underline>, <underline>financial institutions</underline>, any other mid-to-large-size organizations
  with business-critical operations seeking enhanced control over their environment.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 <yellow underline>Private cloud</yellow> can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) data-center, or it can be hosted by a dedicated
 data-center offsite (third-party service provider). Private cloud comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment.
</p>

<p class="text">
 It provides much greater control for the company and its IT department, you are completely responsible for the services and infrastructure on your private network, and
 you purchase and provide maintenance of the hardware and software services you provide solely to your organization.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 In private cloud we can have data that cannot be put in the public cloud e.g. because a government policy requires specific data to be kept in-country or privately.
 Using private cloud makes it easier to customize its resources to meet specific IT requirements and business policies.
</div>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <p class="list-title">- Private cloud key characteristics :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Everything runs on your own data-center, so you are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.</li>
  <li>Self-service should be provided, you as organization have complete control over resources and security.</li>
  <li>You maintain the hardware, it must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="list-content custom check">
 <p class="list-title">- Advantages of private cloud :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   More flexibility - your organization can customize its cloud environment (can support any scenario) to meet specific business needs like strict security, compliance,
   or legal requirements. Also ensure the configuration can support legacy application
  </li>
  <li>
   More control - resources are not shared with others, you are responsible for higher levels of security control and privacy.
   <small>(Total control over security and infrastructure)</small>

<p class="sub-title">3. Hybrid cloud - Public/Private Clouds</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->

<p class="text">
 <yellow underline>A hybrid cloud</yellow> is a computing environment that uses both public and private cloud (on-premises) in inter-connected environment, which allow
 your data and apps to move/share between the two environments. It simple combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most
 appropriate location.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <yellow underline>A hybrid cloud</yellow> environment can be used to allow a private cloud to <tooltip text="sudden increase">surge</tooltip> for increased, temporary
 demand by deploying public cloud resources.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to
  their private cloud infrastructure.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="list-content normal disc">
 <p class="list-title">- Hybrid cloud is helpful when you have some things that cannot be put in the cloud, maybe for legal reasons like:-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>when hosting a website in the public cloud and link it to a highly secure database hosted in your private cloud (or on-premises data-center).</li>
  <li>Some specific pieces of data that cannot be exposed publicly (such as medical data) which needs to be held in your private datacenter.</li>
  <li>An application that run on old hardware that can't be updated. Keep the old system & connect it to the public cloud for authorization or storage.</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="underline-text">- Many companies/organizations choose a hybrid cloud approach due to business imperatives such as :</p>

<div class="list-content normal arrow">
 <ul>
  <li>
   <tooltip text="by following rules and determine which laws and compliance regulations apply to the company's industry and operations">Meeting regulatory</tooltip>
  </li>

   >
   requirements
  </li>
  <li>or taking full advantage of on-premises technology investment, or addressing low latency issues.</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  Hybrid cloud workload allow users within organization or closer to where data resides to communicate their devices with either clouds to reduce latency and spend less
  time or offline time communicating between clouds, which balance computing power and less workload on-premises private cloud.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="underline-text red">- With hybrid cloud is flexible with what you run locally versus in the cloud :-</p>

<div class="list-content normal arrow">
 <ul>
  <li>Easier migration to Azure</li>
  <li>Cloud-bursting: Use cloud when your compute resources are not enough</li>
  <li>Pass data back and forth: Process part of your data in cloud, part of it on-premises.</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 When computing and processing demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud computing gives businesses the ability to seamlessly scale up their on-premises infrastructure to the
 public cloud to handle any overflow without giving third-party data-centers access to the entirety of their data.
</p>

<div class="list-content custom star">
 <p class="list-title">- Advantages of hybrid cloud :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Cost-effectiveness - Take advantage of economies of scale from public cloud providers for services and resources where it's cheaper, and then supplement with your own
   equipment when it's not. Companies will pay only for resources they temporarily use instead of having to purchase, program, and maintain additional resources and
   equipment that could remain idle over long periods of time.
  </li>
  <li>
   It eliminates the need to make massive capital expenditures to handle short-term spikes in demand, as well as when the business needs to free up local resources for
   more sensitive data or applications.
  </li>
  <li>
   You can keep any systems running and accessible that use out-of-date hardware or an out-of-date operating system. Organizations determine where to run their
   applications.
  </li>
  <li>
   Use your own equipment to meet security, compliance, or legacy scenarios where you need to completely control the environment. Organizations gain the flexibility and
   innovation the public cloud provides by running certain workloads in the cloud while keeping highly sensitive data in their own data-center to meet client needs or
   regulatory requirements.
  </li>
  <li>Ease - transitioning to the cloud doesn't have to be overwhelming because you can migrate gradually-phasing in workloads over time.</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="list-content custom red_cross">
 <p class="list-title">- Disadvantages of hybrid cloud :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>More expensive than selecting one deployment model since it involves some CapEx cost up front</li>
  <li>More complicated to set up and manage due to larger landscape</li>
  <li>Most dependent on IT skills & expertise from all three models</li>
 </ul>

<!-- ######################################################### -->
<p class="sub-title">4. Multi-cloud</p>
<!-- ######################################################### -->

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Multi-cloud</underline> means you use multiple cloud providers. You may deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and
 security in both environments.
</p>

<underline blue># Why using Multi-cloud ?</underline>

<div class="quote-text blue-border">
 <p>
  Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a
