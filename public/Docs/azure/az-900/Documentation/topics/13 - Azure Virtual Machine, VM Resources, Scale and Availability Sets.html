  Virtualization is an emulation of physical machines that create virtual machines with different Operating System and virtual hardware. Each virtual machine has it's own
  configuration and OS. We can say its a Total separation of OS environments.

 Azure VMs gives you flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs the VM. As you know VMs provide IaaS offering, which
 mean you still need to maintain the virtual machine by performing tasks, such as
 <underline>configure</underline>, <underline>updating/patching</underline> and <underline>maintaining/installing</underline> the software that runs on it.
