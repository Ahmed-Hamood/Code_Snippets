<p class="text">
 In order to host an applications then we probably need VM or container for the hosting solution. As we know VMs is the best hosting method and it gives you a full
 control over the hosting environment and allow to configure it exactly how you want.
</p>

<p class="text">Container is a compelling hosting solution option for isolating apps and individually manage each app separately with it own environment</p>

<p class="text">
 What if i tell you that you can host your apps without the need of managing infrastructure like creating VMs and deploying Containers, Azure provides app services that
 will do all the hosting for us. You build your app with all packages and codes and send it to azure app service, and azure will host it for you.

<p class="text">
 Azure app service is a simple an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications <small gray>(different runtimes and programming languages)</small>, it enables you to
 build and host <underline yellow>web apps</underline>, <underline yellow>background jobs</underline>,<underline yellow> mobile back-ends</underline>, and
 <underline yellow>RESTful APIs</underline> in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  Azure app service is PaaS offering, the main purpose of this service is building web applications. We just ask developers to prepare a simple deployment package/code
  and send it to app service.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 App Service supports Windows and Linux. It enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model. Azure App
 Service lets you focus on building and maintaining your app, and Azure focuses on keeping the environment up and running.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <p class="list-title">App Service handles most of the infrastructure decisions you deal with in hosting web-accessible apps :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Deployment and management are integrated into the platform.</li>
  <li>Endpoints can be secured.</li>
  <li>Sites can be scaled quickly to handle high traffic loads.</li>
  <li>The built-in load balancing and traffic manager provide high availability.</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<p class="text">
 App service offers automatic scaling and high availability features. You can scale up to <number>20</number> or <number>100</number> nodes
 <small>(Vms underneath)</small> depend on the pricing tier.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  The pricing based on app service plan, a set of compute resources is created for that plan in that region. Each App Service plan defines:
  <underline>Regions</underline>, <underline>Number of VM instances</underline>, <underline>size of VMs</underline> and <underline>pricing tier</underline>. The pricing
  tier of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <p class="list-title">Three Pricing Tier are currently available :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Shared Compute Dev/Test (Free and Shared)</underline> – The app is run on the same VM as other apps; scaling is not an option. This plan is good for
   development and testing environment. Ideal for less demanding workloads. Focused on providing shared infrastructure. Additional features include custom domains / SSL
   and manual scale.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Dedicated compute (Basic, Standard, Premium, Premium v2) Production</underline> – Apps are run on a dedicated VMs; apps in the same App Service plan
   shared the same compute resources. Ideal for more demanding workloads. Additional features include staging slots, daily backups, and a traffic manager.
  </li>
  <li><underline yellow>Isolated</underline> - dedicated VMs run in dedicated vNETs. Ideal for workloads that require advanced networking and fine-grained scaling.</li>
 </ul>

<p class="title-text green">- With App Service, you can host most common web app styles, such as :</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 <underline red>Web Apps</underline> - build and deploy web apps faster at scale. App Service includes full support for hosting web apps by using <text>ASP.NET</text>,
 <text>ASP.NET Core</text>, <text>Java</text>, <text>Ruby</text>, <text>Node.js</text>, <text>PHP</text>, or <text>Python</text>. You can choose either Windows or Linux
 as the host operating system.
</p>

<p class="underline-text">- Available run-times, programming languages and containers :</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<img id="image" path="/img/image076.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text"><underline red>API Apps</underline> – easily build and consume APIs. You can build REST-based web APIs by using your choice of language and framework.</p>

<p class="text"><underline red> Web App for containers</underline> - deploy and run containerized web apps.</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline red>WebJobs</underline> - WebJobs are often used to run background tasks as part of your application logic. You can use the WebJobs feature to run a
 program (<text>.exe</text>, <text>Java</text>, <text>PHP</text>, <text>Python</text>, or <text>Node.js</text>) or script (<terminal>.cmd</terminal>,
 <terminal>.bat</terminal>, <terminal>PowerShell</terminal>, or <terminal>Bash</terminal>) in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app. They can be scheduled
 or run by a trigger.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline red>Mobile apps</underline> - Use the Mobile Apps feature of App Service to quickly build a back end for iOS and Android apps. With just a few actions in
 the Azure portal, you can:
</p>

<div class="list-content normal">
 <ul>
  <li>Store mobile app data in a cloud-based SQL database.</li>
  <li>Authenticate customers against common social providers, such as MSA, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.</li>
  <li>Send push notifications.</li>
  <li>Execute custom back-end logic in C# or Node.js.</li>
 </ul>
