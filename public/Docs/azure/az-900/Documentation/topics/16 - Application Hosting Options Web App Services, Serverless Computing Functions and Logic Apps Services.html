<p class="text">
 In order to host an applications then we probably need VM or container for the hosting solution. As we know VMs is the best hosting method and it gives you a full
 control over the hosting environment and allow to configure it exactly how you want.
</p>

<p class="text">Container is a compelling hosting solution option for isolating apps and individually manage each app separately with it own environment</p>

<p class="text">
 What if i tell you that you can host your apps without the need of managing infrastructure like creating VMs and deploying Containers, Azure provides app services that
 will do all the hosting for us. You build your app with all packages and codes and send it to azure app service, and azure will host it for you.

 Azure app service is a simple an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications <small gray>(different runtimes and programming languages)</small>, it enables you to
 build and host <underline yellow>web apps</underline>, <underline yellow>background jobs</underline>,<underline yellow> mobile back-ends</underline>, and
 <underline yellow>RESTful APIs</underline> in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  Azure app service is PaaS offering, the main purpose of this service is building web applications. We just ask developers to prepare a simple deployment package/code
  and send it to app service.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 App Service supports Windows and Linux. It enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model. Azure App
 Service lets you focus on building and maintaining your app, and Azure focuses on keeping the environment up and running.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <p class="list-title">App Service handles most of the infrastructure decisions you deal with in hosting web-accessible apps :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Deployment and management are integrated into the platform.</li>
  <li>Endpoints can be secured.</li>
  <li>Sites can be scaled quickly to handle high traffic loads.</li>
  <li>The built-in load balancing and traffic manager provide high availability.</li>

  The pricing based on app service plan, a set of compute resources is created for that plan in that region. Each App Service plan defines:
  <underline>Regions</underline>, <underline>Number of VM instances</underline>, <underline>size of VMs</underline> and <underline>pricing tier</underline>. The pricing
  tier of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <p class="list-title">Three Pricing Tier categories are currently available :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Shared Compute Dev/Test (Free and Shared)</underline> – The app is run on the same VM as other apps; scaling is not an option. This plan is good for
   development and testing environment. Ideal for less demanding workloads. Focused on providing shared infrastructure. Additional features include custom domains / SSL
   and manual scale.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Dedicated compute (Basic, Standard, Premium, Premium v2) Production</underline> – Apps are run on a dedicated VMs; apps in the same App Service plan
   shared the same compute resources. Ideal for more demanding workloads. Additional features include staging slots, daily backups, and a traffic manager.
  </li>
  <li><underline yellow>Isolated</underline> - dedicated VMs run in dedicated vNETs. Ideal for workloads that require advanced networking and fine-grained scaling.</li>

<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- ######################################################### -->
<!-- #region start -->

<p class="text">
 <bold>Serverless</bold> is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage Infrastructures servers. With
 serverless computing you can build applications faster by eliminating the need to maintain virtual machines or containers.
</p>

<p class="text">With Azure, when talking about serverless computing, we need to refer to two azure services:</p>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <ul>
  <li><underline yellow>Azure Functions</underline>: Functions can execute code in almost any modern language.</li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Azure logic Apps</underline>: Logic apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any
   code.
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  Serverless means that the infrastructure provision and management are invisible to the developer. There are still servers in serverless, but they are
  <tooltip desc="detached or separated">abstracted</tooltip> away from app development.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">Servers are still running the code, everything is run behind the scene by azure cloud. We have three main pillars of serverless computing.</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless
  vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers.
 </p>
</div>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">- Abstraction of servers</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 Servers are completely abstracted from the underlying hosting environment. You don't need to configure or maintain the infrastructure you simply upload your code to
 azure and it runs with assuring High Availability and scalability.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Azure will automatically scale resources to maintain stable performance by allocation/deallocation of resources, You never explicitly reserve capacity.
</p>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">- Event-Driven Scale</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 With serverless computing your code run based on trigger or events, for example it runs function when it receives an HTTP request, this process is good fit for workloads
 that respond to incoming events like notification message when you order something.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The platform automatically schedules the function to run and scales the number of compute instances based on the rate of incoming events. Either event invoked by users
 or event that will run everyday at a specific time.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  A function contains both code and metadata about its triggers and bindings. Triggers define how a function is invoked. And Bindings provide a declarative way to connect
  to services from within the code. For example you order something the order function get triggered or called, within the function we have codes that binds with other
  functions or services that will allow us to generate a reply message to customer
 </p>
</div>

<div class="list-content normal number">
 <p class="list-title">Event include trigger by :</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Timers For example, if a function needs to run every day at <number>10:00 AM</number> UTC.</li>
  <li>
   HTTP like API and
   <tooltip
    desc="Webhooks typically are used to connect two different applications. When an event happens on the trigger application, it serializes data about that event and sends it to a webhook URL from the action application—the one you want to do something based on the data from the first application. <red> - What is difference between API and webhook?</red> <br />
    An application programming interface (API) is a software interface that serves as a bridge between computers and applications. A webhook is a way for one application to deliver data to another app in real-time."

  <li>Queues - with order processing</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<!-- ------------ -->
<p class="title-text green">- Micro-billing (Pay by the run time)</p>
<!-- ------------ -->

<p class="text">
 You pay only for the duration your code runs, if your function is not active or no executions occur, then you are not charged. for example, if the code runs once a day
 for two minutes, they're charged for one execution and two minutes of computing time.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <p class="list-title">We can simply say :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>You only pay for the time the code runs.</li>
  <li>No active function executions occur therefore there is not charge</li>

  Using a virtual machine-based approach, you'd incur costs even when the virtual machine is idle. With functions, Azure runs your code when it's triggered and
  automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished. In this model, you're only charged for the CPU time used while your function runs.

 Azure function is similar to app service, but the difference is in app service we were creating a full-fledged web services or web applications, but if we want to run a
 small piece of code, let’s say we have a function that adds two numbers a and b and return for us the result. We can use azure function to run this small piece of code.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image077.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 We ask developers to prepare a small package and deploy our function up across multiple nodes (VMs underneath) and expose it as a web service. Here we host a small piece
 of code very effectively.

<p class="text">
 With Azure function service, auto-scaling feature is supported from <number>0</number> to <number>200</number> servers. It is one of the more scalable services in azure

  Every Azure logic app workflow starts with a trigger, which fires when a specific event happens or when newly available data meets specific criteria. Many triggers
  include basic scheduling capabilities, so developers can specify how regularly their workloads will run. Each time the trigger fires, the Logic Apps engine creates a
  logic app instance that runs the actions in the workflow. These actions can also include data conversions and flow controls, such as conditional statements, switch
  statements, loops, and branching.
