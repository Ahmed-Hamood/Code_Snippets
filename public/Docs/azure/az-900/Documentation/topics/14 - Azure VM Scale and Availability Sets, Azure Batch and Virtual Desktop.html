 You can have multiple VMs grouped together to provide high availability, scalability, and redundancy. Also grouping and manage VMs provide features such as scale sets
 and availability sets. There are multiple options to manage the availability of your virtual machines in Azure.

<p class="text">
 Virtual machine scale set - VMSS lets you create and manage a group of identical virtual machine from the same image. With <text>auto-scaled</text> feature the number of
 VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to traffic demand or a defined schedule.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Azure Scale set allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes to provide highly available applications thru regional or multiple
 Availability Zones deployment options.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  To achieve high availability, a minimum of <number>2</number> VMs should be placed in <text>VMSS</text> (Scale Sets) with Azure SLA met of <number>99.95%</number>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 If you have two VMs with the same purpose then you have to make sure that both of them are configured identically and then set up network routing parameters or requests
 between multiple instances of the website. Virtual machine scale sets could do that work for you to ensure efficiency.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>Virtual machine scale set - VMSS is designed for manual and auto-scaled workloads like web services and batch processing.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Azure scale set also automatically deploy a <text green>load balancer</text> to balance or control traffic between VMs. It makes sure that your resources are being used
 efficiently.
</p>

<p class="text">
 The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. With virtual machine scale sets , you can build
 large-scale services for different workload areas such as <underline>compute</underline>, <underline>big data</underline>, and
 <underline>container</underline> workloads.
</p>

<div class="text-box">

  In the image below, Azure scale set allow you to pick an image either custom image or marketplace image, this image is automatically scaled across multiple virtual
  machines.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  below, we have <number>3</number> virtual machine, they are hidden behind a load balancer, which redirect traffic from your users to one of those virtual machines
  within the scale set.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  In the image above, we have defined a virtual network, with IP Address spaces of three VMs, these VMs are for serving web application all of them working and
  functioning fine. The three VMs are a part of virtual machine scale sets, with public facing load balancer that receives connections from customers/users.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  When your customers want to connection to your website, first they will hit the public facing load balancer, then load balancer will take this connection or HTTP
  connection and split the traffic to these three web servers. When traffic increases a web server will be added into the VMSS, and if the traffic decreases, then servers
  will be extracted/removed from the <text red>VMSS</text>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Also azure provide you with tools that help you to monitor the utilization to determine if you need to increase or decrease the number of VMs but if you enable the scale
 set feature then you don't need to do that.

</div>

<p class="text">
 Availability sets is logical grouping of two or more VMs that help keep your application available during planned or unplanned maintenance to provide resilient, highly
 available environment.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Availability Sets ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power
 failure.
</p>

<p class="text">
 An Availability Zone in azure is a combination of a <text>fault domain</text> and an <text>update domain</text>. With Availability Set azure ensure that the VMs you
 place in the Availability Set are different fault/update domains to avoid downtime.
</p>

<p class="text">
 With Availability Sets, azure will split your fleet of VMs on different racks of servers, which are called <underline yellow>Fault Domains</underline>; to prevent app
 outage in case of unplanned maintenance events (power, hardware failure, etc)
</p>

<p class="text">
 Also, with Availability Sets <underline yellow>Update Domain</underline>, azure will have a number or group of VMs to prevent application outage in case of VM reboot or
 planned maintenance window in azure.

<p class="text">
 Fault domains is a logical grouping of hardware to a void a single point of failure within AZ, which mean azure groups your VMs by common power source and network switch
 By default. Each VM's has it's own power and switch within two different racks in the data-center.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>The reason that azure does this if a part of the data-center fails, then the other servers will take charge because they don't share the same power source.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 An availability set FD will split your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different
 fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).

<div class="list-content normal disc">
 <p class="list-title">Unplanned maintenance events :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Involve a hardware failure in the data center e.g. a power outage or disk failure</li>

<p class="text">
 In the example below, we we have two virtual machines that are a part of an availability Sets, so both of these virtual machines serve content. If something happens
 planned or un-panned in <code>Fault Domain #1</code>, we still have a virtual machine sits in <code>Fault Domain #2</code> on different rack to server the content.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image069.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 Also, we also have two different update domains <number>1</number> and <number>2</number>, so if an update happens it will do that not in the same time. It will first
 update domain <number>1</number> then update domain <number>2</number>. This helps for planned maintenance windows; we can have another two VMs sitting on a different
 availability sets in different update domain.
</p>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  With an availability set, you get, up to <number>3</number> fault domains each have a server rack with dedicated power and network resources.And also you get
  <number>5</number> logical update domains can be increased to a maximum of <number>20</number>.
 </p>
</div>

<img id="image" path="/img/image070.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Fault domain</underline> if it set to three, mean you reserve three racks, and you must have at least <number>3</number> VMs or UD. All VMs gonna
 spread across three different racks, so If a rack goes out the other racks are operational and your service will remain available.
</p>

<p class="text">
 <underline yellow>Update Domain</underline> if you set it to <number>5</number>, then these machine in the same or different racks, they won't be updated at the same
 time. As you see our VMs are spread in different racks, if VMs numbers more than the rack number then a single rack can have more than one.
</p>

<div class="text-box info">
 <p>
  There's no additional cost for configuring an availability set. You only pay for the VM instances you create. An Example of availability Sets. We have two fault domain
  which means we have equipment's in two different racks in the data-center.
