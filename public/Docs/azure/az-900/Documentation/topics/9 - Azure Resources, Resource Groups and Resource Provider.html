 <underline yellow>Resource groups</underline> is a logical container for only resources, it's simply used for grouping related resources. When you create a resource,
 you're required to place it into a resource group.

 <underline yellow>Resource group</underline> is utility that provides a convenient way to group resources together to manage and organize them in a better way. You

  </li>
  <li>
   A resource can connect to resources in other resource groups. This scenario is common when the two resources are related but don't share the same lifecycle. For
   example, you can have a web app that connects to a database in a different resource group.
  </li>
  <li>You can deploy up to <number>800</number> instances of a resource type in each resource group. Some resources have a limit on the number instances per region.</li>
  <li>
   Some resources can exist outside of a resource group. These resources are deployed to the subscription, management group, or tenant. Only specific resource types are
   supported at these scopes.

  If a resource group's region is temporarily unavailable, you can't update resources in the resource group because the metadata is unavailable. The resources in other

 Its good to have a consistent naming convention for your resource group, when deciding on a naming convention to standardize on, there are several different naming

  <li>another option is <code>&lt;Resource>-&lt;subscriptionType>-&lt;Region></code> like <green>VNET-Shared01-WestUS</green></li>

<p class="title-text yellow">- Here are the most common naming convention components :-</p>

   <underline yellow>Azure Region</underline>: The Azure Region where the resource is deployed.Such as <text>East US 2</text> or <text>Central US</text>. An example

 As we know resource groups exist to help you manage and organize your azure resources in many ways. There aren't hard rules about how you organize or use your resource
 groups, you organize them base on your organization needs there is no-policy on how we organize them.
</p>

<p class="text">
 You might put all resources that are core infrastructure (VNET, VM, DB) into this resource group, but you could also organize resources strictly by resource type.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal">
 <p class="list-title">- Organize RG based on your organization but consider :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li><underline yellow>Billing</underline>: A way to filter and sort the data to better understand where costs are allocated.</li>
  <li><underline yellow>Application Lifecycle</underline>: Allows to apply an action to a resource group for example, delete RG after experimentation</li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Security and access management</underline>: Authorization who needs to administer them check RBAC. For example, databases in database administration
   group to give access to database administrators.
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  Organize based on billing, placing resources in the same resource group is a way to group them for usage in billing reports. If you're trying to understand how your
  costs are distributed in your Azure environment, grouping them by resource group is one way to filter and sort the data to better understand where costs are allocated.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 We organize or place resources of a similar <text blue>usage</text>, <text blue>type</text>, or <text blue>location</text> in a resource group. You can have your
 development resource groups separated from your production resource group so you can apply different.

 <p>
  <text>example 1</text> - if you're setting up a temporary dev environment, grouping all the resources together means you can deprovision all of the associated resources
  at once by deleting the resource group.

</div>

<div class="text-box">
 <p>
  <text>example 2</text> - lets say you're provisioning compute resources that will need three different access schemas, it may be best to group resources based on the
  access schema, and then assign access at the resource group level.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="title-text green"># Organize resource by resource type (virtual networks, virtual machines, dbs) :-</p>

<p class="text">
 You could also organize resources strictly by resource type. For example, put all virtual networks in one resource group, all virtual machines in another resource group,
 and all Azure Cosmos DB instances in another resource group.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image038.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="title-text green"># Organize resources by environment :-</p>

<p class="text">
 You might put all resources that are core infrastructure (VNET, VM, DB) into this resource group, and organize them by environment (prod, qa, dev). In this case, all
 production resources are in one resource group, all test resources are in another resource group, and so on.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image039.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="title-text green"># Organize resource by department name :-</p>

<p class="text">
 You could organize them by department (marketing, finance, human resources). Marketing resources go in one resource group, finance in another resource group, and HR in a
 third resource group.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image040.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="title-text green"># Organize resource by combining strategies :-</p>

<p class="text">
 You could even use a combination of these strategies and organize by environment and department. Put production finance resources in one resource group, dev finance
 resources in another, and the same for the marketing resources.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image041.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="title-text green"># Organize resource by lifecycle :-</p>

<p class="text">
 Use this to your advantage, especially in areas where resources are more disposable, like non-production environments. If you deploy 10 servers for a project that you
 know will only last a couple of months, you might put them all in a single resource group. One resource group is easier to clean up than 10 or more resource groups.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image042.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="title-text green"># Organize resource by Admin type :-</p>

<p class="text">
 You can organize resources by who needs to administer them. If your database administration team is responsible for managing all of your Azure SQL Database instances,
 putting them in the same resource group would simplify administration.
</p>

<p class="text">
 You could give the team the proper permissions at the resource-group level to administer the databases within the resource group. Similarly, the database administration
 team could be denied access to the resource group with virtual networks so they don't inadvertently make changes to resources outside the scope of their responsibility.
