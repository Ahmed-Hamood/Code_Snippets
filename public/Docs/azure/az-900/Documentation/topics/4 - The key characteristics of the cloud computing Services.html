 2. Scalability <small red>(Performance scaling <green>Up/Down - In/Out</green>)</small>
</p>
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p class="text">
 Scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to adjust by adding/removing resources to meet the demand. Sometime you experience peak in traffic that cause your
 system to be slow or overwhelmed, here the ability of scaling will allow you to add more resources to better handle the increased demand and to make your system perform
 effectively.
</p>

<p class="text">
 Your ability to increase your capacity based on the increasing demand to traffic, memory and computing power. If you own a company sometime you need to scale up with
 better and bigger servers. With cloud provider you don't need to buy servers, you only pay for what you use. If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and
 thereby reduce your costs.
</p>

<img id="image" path="/img/image004.PNG" alt="image" />

<div class="list-content normal check">
 <p class="list-title">Scaling comes in two varieties :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Vertical Scaling</underline>: is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources like increase Ram capacity - CPU Cores/speed -
   storage size.
  </li>
  <li><underline yellow>Horizontal Scaling</underline>: is focused on adding or subtracting the number of resources like adding more servers/vms.</li>
 </ul>
</div>

<!-- ************************************************************** -->
<p class="sub-sub-sub-title">- Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/down)</p>
<!-- ************************************************************** -->

<p class="text">
 In Vertical scaling we just upgrade our server resources like increase the CPU processing power or add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine, or add more hard-drive
 space. If you realize later that you over-specified the specification needs, you could easily lower the vertical scaling by lowering the CPU or RAM specifications.
</p>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <ul>
  <li>Increase (up) or decrease (down) the memory, storage, or compute power on an existing virtual machine.</li>

<p class="sub-sub-title">3. Elasticity <small red>(Automatic scaling base-on demand)</small></p>
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p class="text">
 Elasticity is your ability to automatically/dynamically increase or decrease your capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory and computing power.
</p>

<div class="quote-text green-border">
 <p>The key different between High Scalability and High Elasticity is you can increase or decrease the demand automatically.</p>
</div>

<img id="image" path="/img/image009.PNG" alt="image" />

<p class="text">
 To achieve high elasticity we need to use vertical scaling instead of horizontal scaling, because if you have to increase the number of storage drive and then decrease
 it, you could lose data. .That is not a good idea, so its easier and better to do vertical scaling with high elasticity.
