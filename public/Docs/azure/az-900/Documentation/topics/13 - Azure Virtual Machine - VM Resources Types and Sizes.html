 With VM you take a subset or smaller hardware part of <underline yellow>CPU</underline>, <underline yellow>RAM</underline> or <underline yellow>HD/SSD</underline> to
 create a virtual machine that will run a separate operating system from the actual server.

<div class="text-box note">
 <p>
  A piece of software called a <underline>hypervisor</underline>, or <underline>virtual machine manager</underline>, lets you run different operating systems on different

  Windows OS.

<p class="text">
 VMs like a physical computer they host an operating system and you can install, run and customize all of the software running on your VM. VM are independent of each
 other, and they are extremely portable. You can move a VM on a hypervisor to another hypervisor on a completely different machine almost instantaneously.

<p class="text">
 Azure VMs gives you flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs the VM. As you know VMs provide IaaS offering, which
 mean you still need to maintain the virtual machine by performing tasks, such as
 <underline>configure</underline>, <underline>updating/patching</underline> and <underline>maintaining/installing</underline> the software that runs on it.

 <p class="list-title">Some common examples or use cases for virtual machines include:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Total control over the operating system (OS)</underline>: You can create or run your own custom software/environment for developing and testing and
   use custom hosting configurations.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>During testing and development</underline>: We can easily create and delete VMs, with VMs we can create different OS and application configuration to
   code and test an application.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Running a traditional infrastructure app</underline>: we can run certain applications in the public cloud and run traditional app in your own
   premises, you can use public cloud on demand, shutting down VMs when you don't need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay
   only for the resources you use.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>When extending your data-center to the cloud </underline>: An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a
   virtual network in Azure and adding VMs to that virtual network.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Lift and shift</underline>: Moving from physical data-center to cloud. You can take image of the server & run within a VM with little to no changes.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>During disaster recovery (Backing up your existing OS)</underline>: As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an
   on-premises network to the cloud, you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery. If a primary data-center fails, you can
   create VMs running on Azure to run your critical applications and then shut them down when the primary data-center becomes operational again.
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<div class="list-content normal star">
 <p class="list-title">virtual machines provide many benefits, such as :-</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Cost savings</underline> - running multiple virtual environments from one piece of infrastructure means that you can drastically reduce your physical
   infrastructure footprint. This boosts your bottom line-decreasing the need to maintain nearly as many servers and saving on maintenance costs and electricity.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Agility and speed</underline> - Spinning up a VM is relatively easy and quick and is much simpler than provisioning an entire new environment for
   your developers. Virtualization makes the process of running dev-test scenarios a lot quicker.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Lowered downtime</underline> - VMs are so portable and easy to move from one hypervisor to another on a different machine - this means that they are
   a great solution for backup, in the event the host goes down unexpectedly.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Scalability</underline> - VMs allow you to more easily scale your apps by adding more physical or virtual servers to distribute the workload across
   multiple VMs. As a result you can increase the availability and performance of your apps.
  </li>
  <li>
   <underline yellow>Security benefits</underline> - Because virtual machines run in multiple operating systems, using a guest operating system on a VM allows you to run
   apps of questionable security and protects your host operating system. VMs also allow for better security forensics, and are often used to safely study computer
   viruses, isolating the viruses to avoid risking their host computer.

  If you have virtual machines with un-managed disks, you can convert your virtual machines to be backed with Managed Disks. Also you can also manage your custom images
