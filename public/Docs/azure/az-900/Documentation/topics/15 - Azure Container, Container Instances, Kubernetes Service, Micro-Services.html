 Container is a virtualization runtime environment for running apps, you can run multiple containers isolated and secured on a single physical or

 for each application, you can have multiple containers within a single runtime. Container run on top of a host operating system like VMs.

 Containers bundle the libraries and components needed to run the application and use the existing host OS to run the container. You can run multiple isolated
 applications on each single container. You can use same server to host multiple container applications.

 <p>If you have five containers running on a server with a specific Linux kernel, all five containers and the apps within them share that same Linux kernel.</p>

 Containers are lightweight and designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically, they are designed for almost any scenario. It's possible to create and deploy
 virtual machines as application demand increases, but containers are a lighter weight, more <tooltip desc="able to move quickly and easily.">agile</tooltip> method.

 <ul>
  <li>less Development efforts for your team</li>
  <li>less Maintenance, you don't need to maintain the operating system patches and updates</li>
  <li>Less compute and storage requirement from these containers, because there is no operating system</li>
  <li>Respond quicker to demand changes, so you can auto scale faster than with virtual machines</li>
 </ul>

<p class="text">
 Containers are designed to allow you to respond quicker to changes on demand. With containers, you can quickly restart if there's a crash or hardware interruption. One
 of the most popular container engines is <text blue>Docker</text>, which is supported by Azure.

<div class="text-box info">

  Containers are often used to create solutions by using a microservice architecture. This architecture is where you break solutions into smaller, independent pieces.
  <underline yellow>For example</underline>, you might split a website into a container hosting your front end, another hosting your back end, and a third for storage.
  This split allows you to separate portions of your app into logical sections that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
 Imagine your website back-end has reached capacity but the front end and storage aren't being stressed. With containers, you could scale the back end separately to
 improve performance. If something
 <tooltip desc="- make (something) necessary as a result or consequence. - make it necessary for (someone) to do something.">necessitated</tooltip> such a change, you
 could also choose to change the storage service or modify the front end without impacting any of the other components.
