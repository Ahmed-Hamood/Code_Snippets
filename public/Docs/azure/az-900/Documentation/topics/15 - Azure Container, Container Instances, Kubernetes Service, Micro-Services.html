 Containers bundle the libraries and components needed to run the application and use the existing host OS to run the container. You can run multiple isolated
 applications on each container. You can use same server or VM to host multiple container applications.

 Containers are lightweight and designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically, they are designed for almost any scenario. It's possible to create and deploy

  Containers are often used to create solutions by using a microservice architecture. This architecture is where you break solutions into smaller, independent pieces.
  <underline yellow>For example</underline>, you might split a website into a container hosting your front end, another hosting your back end, and a third for storage or
  database. This split allows you to separate portions of your app into logical sections that can be maintained, scaled, or updated independently.

 Imagine your website back-end has reached capacity but the front end and storage aren't being stressed. With containers, you could scale the back end separately to
 improve performance. If something
 <tooltip desc="1. make (something) necessary as a result or consequence. 2. make it necessary for (someone) to do something.">necessitated</tooltip> such a change, you
 could also choose to change the storage service or modify the front end without impacting any of the other components.
